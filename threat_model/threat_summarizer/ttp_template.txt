For each identified technique, provide:
1. The technique ID (e.g., T1566.001)
2. The technique name
3. The tactic category
4. A confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on how strongly the evidence supports this mapping

Respond in this exact JSON format:
```json
{
  "ttps": [
    {
      "technique_id": "T1566.001",
      "technique_name": "Spearphishing Attachment",
      "tactic": "Initial Access",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence": "Brief explanation of why this technique was identified"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Only include techniques with confidence >= 0.5
- Maximum 5 techniques per analysis
- Use exact technique IDs from the provided context
- If no techniques match confidently, return an empty list
