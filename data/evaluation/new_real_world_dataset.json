BeyondTrust is an identity and access management platform. This specific vulnerability involves a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) issue within BeyondTrust remote support software. It could allow attackers to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, which may lead to system compromise, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration and service disruption.\nUnit 42 is actively investigating exploitation of this vulnerability and has observed attacker activity consistent with the following:\nNetwork reconnaissance and account creation\nWebshell deployment\nCommand-and-control (C2) traffic\nBackdoor and remote management tool deployment\nLateral movement\nData theft\nThe campaign tracked by Unit 42 has so far affected the following sectors in the U.S., France, Germany, Australia and Canada:\nFinancial services\nLegal services\nHigh technology\nHigher education\nWholesale and retail\nHealthcare\nDue to the severity of the risk and confirmed active exploitation, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on Feb. 13, 2026. This addition mandated immediate remediation for federal agencies and signaled urgent prioritization for the private sector.\nAt the time of publication, Palo Alto Networks\nCortex Xpanse\nhas identified the presence of 16,400-plus exposed instances potentially vulnerable to CVE-2026-1731 based on our telemetry.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from CVE-2026-1731 through the following products:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nand\nAdvanced DNS Security\nCortex XDR\nand\nXSIAM\nCortex Xpanse\nPalo Alto Networks also recommends that BeyondTrust self-hosted customers of Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access manually patch any instances that are not subscribed to automatic updates in the appliance interface in accordance with their\nFebruary 2026 advisory\n.\nThe\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\ncan also be engaged to help with a compromise or to provide a proactive assessment to lower your risk.\nVulnerabilities Discussed\nCVE-2026-1731\nDetails of CVE-2026-1731\nCVE-2026-1731 is a critical RCE vulnerability affecting the\nthin-scc-wrapper\ncomponent of unpatched versions of BeyondTrust remote support software. This component is exposed to the network and handles incoming WebSocket connections.\nThe flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands with high privileges. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.9, reflecting its low attack complexity and the immediate threat to system integrity and confidentiality. Characteristics of this vulnerability include:\nType:\nOS Command Injection (\nCWE-78\n)\nSeverity:\nCritical (CVSS v4 Score: 9.9)\nVector:\nNetwork/Pre-authentication\nAffected Component:\nthin-scc-wrapper script\n(reachable via WebSocket interface)\nThe Mechanism\nThe vulnerability is triggered during the WebSocket handshake process. The backend script,\nthin-scc-wrapper\n, is designed to parse and evaluate the\nremoteVersion\nvalue provided by the connecting client. This value is ostensibly used for version compatibility checks.\nThe Flaw\nThe script uses\nbash arithmetic\ncontexts (such as\n(( ... ))\nor\nlet\n) to compare the version numbers. In bash, these contexts are not strictly limited to integer values. These contexts can also treat operands as expressions. Consequently, if input is not rigorously sanitized, an arithmetic context will evaluate and execute embedded commands \u2014 such as command substitutions\n$(command)\n\u2014 before performing the intended comparison.\nSanitization Failure\nWhile previous patches for this component reportedly introduced numeric coherence checks, our analysis indicates these measures were not fully comprehensive. They failed to prevent the bash interpreter from evaluating expressions within the input string, leaving the endpoint exposed to injection.\nSuccessful exploitation requires no prior authentication or user interaction. The attack sequence typically follows this trajectory:\nConnection:\nThe attacker initiates a standard WebSocket connection to the target appliance, directing traffic to\n/nw [path]\nor endpoints associated with\nget_portal_info\n.\nInjection:\nDuring the handshake phase, the attacker submits an intentionally crafted, malformed\nremoteVersion\nvalue that contains the malicious payload. The payload leverages a specific format, observed in proof-of-concept (PoC) code as\na[$(cmd)]0\n, to force the arithmetic evaluation.\nPayload execution:\nThe\nthin-scc-wrapper\nscript processes the\nremoteVersion\nvalue, inadvertently triggering the malicious payload, which is an injected shell command.\nThe injected commands execute in the context of the \u201csite user.\u201d While this account is distinct from the root user, compromising it effectively grants the attacker control over the appliance's configuration, managed sessions and network traffic.\nCurrent Scope of Attacks Exploiting CVE-2026-1731\nUnit 42 is actively investigating multiple compromises related to the exploitation of CVE-2026-1731. We have observed successful exploitation of the vulnerability followed by attackers leveraging their access to:\nCreate domain accounts\nInstall remote management tools to perform reconnaissance of domain administrators and trusts\nCreate local administrator accounts\nDeploy a backdoor\nAttempt to install additional remote management tools (i.e.,\nSimpleHelp\nand\nAnyDesk\n) and/or tunneling tools (i.e.,\nCloudflare\n)\nData theft\nAdministrative Account Access\nWe have observed attackers using a custom Python script for temporary account takeover, granting access to an administrative account (User ID 1) for 60 seconds before deleting the file to minimize artifact recovery. The Python script functions by querying the target's database to back up the existing password hash for the primary administrator (User ID 1). It leverages the application's own authentication binary (\ncheck_auth\n) to generate a valid hash for the\npassword\nstring password and injects the hash into the database.\nAfter sleeping for one minute, the script restores the original password hash and self-destructs, effectively hiding the intrusion from the legitimate administrator and minimizing forensic artifacts on disk. Figure 1 shows this Python script.\nFigure 1. Custom Python script for administrative account access.\nWeb Shell Activity\nUnit 42 identified attackers installing multiple web shells across directories, including a password-protected one-line PHP web shell. This compact PHP backdoor uses the\neval()\nfunction to execute raw PHP code submitted via the\nPOST['1']\nparameter, contingent on the presence of the\nGET['aaaa']\nparameter. This structure allows attackers to execute post-exploitation tasks such as file uploads or database dumps without writing additional files to disk. Figure 2 shows an example of this one-line PHP web shell.\nFigure 2. One-line PHP web shell seen in activity exploiting CVE-2026-1731.\nWe recovered a compact, multi-vector PHP web shell (\naws.php\n) designed to function as a stealthy execution gate for an automated C2 client. It aggregates all incoming HTTP data sources (\nPOST\n,\nGET\nand\nCookie\n) to locate a specific parameter named\n'ASS'\n, which serves as the payload carrier.\nThe script Base64-decodes this parameter and executes it via\neval()\n, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary PHP code without writing new files to disk. The distinct echoing of\nDQo=\n(CRLF characters) before and after execution acts as a data delimiter, a signature trait of C2 tools like\nChina Chopper\nor\nAntSword\n. These delimiters enable the client software to programmatically extract command output from the noisy HTML response of the compromised page. This PHP web shell is shown below in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. PHP web shell\naws.php\n.\nAttackers also used a bash dropper that employs a \u201cconfig STOMPing\u201d technique to establish a persistent web shell. The script first writes a password-protected PHP backdoor (\nfile_save.php\n) to the web root directory, which executes arbitrary system commands only when the query parameter key equals\nvjwr\n. It then momentarily injects a malicious\nLocation\ndirective into the active Apache configuration file, forcing requests for the backdoor to be handled by a specific Unix socket (\n/ns/tmp/php-fpm.sock\n).\nThe script restarts the Apache service to load this malicious configuration into memory and immediately overwrites the configuration file on disk with a clean backup. This leaves the backdoor fully functional in the running process while ensuring the configuration file on disk appears unmodified to forensic investigators. Figure 4 below shows this bash dropper.\nFigure 4. Bash dropper seen in the attacks.\nMalware\nUnit 42 observed numerous instances of\nSparkRAT\nbackdoor activity across a wide swath of environments. SparkRAT was originally identified in 2023 as being used in a series of attacks nicknamed\nDragonSpark\n. This backdoor is a cross-platform, open-source remote access Trojan (RAT) written in the Go programming language. The tool has been used in\nvarious attacks since 2022\n.\nAttackers have also been leveraging\nVShell\n, a stealthy Linux\nbackdoor [PDF]\nand RAT characterized by its evasion techniques, including fileless memory execution and the ability to masquerade as legitimate system services.\nAlong with PowerShell scripts designed to download and install a Nezha monitoring agent, we also observed a multi-method \"download and execute\" cradle. This strategy is designed to guarantee payload delivery across diverse Linux environments (from servers to IoT devices) by chaining redundant commands (\nwget\n,\ncurl\n,\npython\n,\nbusybox\n). This strategy retrieves a malicious script (\nblue.drx\n) from a legitimate file transfer service and pipes the content directly into sh for immediate execution.\nAdditionally, Unit 42 observed attackers attempting reverse shells to infrastructure consistent with the default Metasploit Meterpreter over port 4444.\nNetwork Defense Evasion via DNS Tunneling\nAttackers used out-of-band (OAST) techniques targeting the Burp Suite Collaborator service\noastify[.]com\nto validate successful code execution and fingerprint compromised systems. Unlike traditional C2 channels that may be blocked by egress filtering, these attacks leverage the DNS protocol to bypass network firewalls.\nBy encoding the victim's hostname into the subdomain of a DNS query (e.g., [\nencoded_hostname\n].[\nattacker_domain\n]), the attacker attempts to disguise the data leaving the network as legitimate-looking DNS traffic. The receiving OAST server logs the query, allowing the attacker to confirm the breach and identify the specific machine without establishing a TCP/HTTP connection.\nThe script used in this attack captures the system hostname, converts it to a hexadecimal string and transmits it via\nnslookup\nqueries to the attacker's OAST domain. Figure 5 below shows an example.\nFigure 5. Example of an\nnslookup\nquery to an attacker's OAST domain.\nThese attacks have used the PowerShell command shown in Figure 6 to handle the\nBitConverter\nencoding and manage DNS label limits (chunking data into 63-character segments) to ensure successful transmission through strict DNS resolvers.\nFigure 6. PowerShell command used in the attacks.\nData Theft\nUnit 42 observed attackers leveraging a remoteVersion parameter injection to execute a complex chain of commands designed to stage, compress and exfiltrate sensitive data. The attackers targeted configuration files, internal system databases and a full PostgreSQL dump, attempting to transmit data to an attacker-controlled C2 server.\nHistoric Context\nThe relationship between CVE-2026-1731 and\nCVE-2024-12356\nhighlights a localized, recurring challenge with input validation within distinct execution pathways. CVE-2024-12356's insufficient validation was using third-party software (postgres), while CVE-2026-1731's insufficient validation problem occurred in the BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and older versions of the BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access (PRA) codebase.\nIn the case of CVE-2024-12356, attackers identified insufficient input validation within a WebSocket endpoint handling logic. By manipulating the\nremoteVersion\nparameter, they successfully bypassed existing validation checks to execute command lines via the\nthin-scc-wrapper\n. This evolution underscores that exposed input-handling pathways remain a primary, high-value target for adversaries seeking pre-authenticated initial access.\nThe significance of this attack surface is underscored by\nhistorical precedent\n. The original vulnerability (\nCVE-2024-12356\n) was exploited by the threat actor Silk Typhoon (aka APT27, UNC5221, Emissary Panda) in high-profile campaigns, including a\nbreach of the U.S. Treasury\nin 2024. This history suggests that CVE-2026-1731 could be a target for sophisticated threat actors seeking similar leverage.\nInterim Guidance\nA February 2026\nBeyond Trust advisory\nrecommends that self-hosted customers of Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access manually patch any instances that are not subscribed to automatic updates in the appliance interface.\nCustomers on a Remote Support version older than 21.3 or on Privileged Remote Access older than 22.1 will need to upgrade to a newer version to apply this patch.\nSelf-hosted customers of Privileged Remote Access may also upgrade to 25.1.1 or a newer version to remediate this vulnerability.\nA patch has been applied to all Remote Support SaaS and Privileged Remote Access SaaS customers as of Feb. 2, 2026, that remediates this vulnerability.\nSelf-hosted customers of Remote Support may also upgrade to 25.3.2 to remediate this vulnerability.\nUnit 42 Managed Threat Hunting Queries\nThe Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting team continues to track any attempts to exploit this CVE across our customers, using Cortex XDR and the XQL queries below.

is a vulnerability that attackers are actively exploiting in systems running unpatched versions of BeyondTrust remote support software. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability can allow attackers to gain RCE privileges. CVE-2026-1731 is related to a similar vulnerability from 2024 that was also noted as exploited in the wild.\nThe recurrence of this type of vulnerability underscores the necessity of defense-in-depth architecture for high-value remote access platforms. Rather than relying solely on patch management, organizations should prioritize architectural containment by strictly limiting administrative interfaces to internal, segmented management networks or zero trust network access gateways. This approach ensures that even if specific code paths remain vulnerable or new variants emerge, the management plane remains shielded from both opportunistic and targeted exploitation attempts.\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members. CTA members use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt malicious cyber actors.

These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on target servers, granting them full control over mobile device management (MDM) infrastructure without requiring user interaction or credentials.\nUnit 42 has observed widespread exploitation of these vulnerabilities, including:\nEstablishing a reverse shell\nInstalling web shells\nConducting reconnaissance\nDownloading malware\nThis campaign also affected the following sectors in the United States, Germany, Australia and Canada:\nState and local government\nHealthcare\nManufacturing\nProfessional and legal services\nHigh technology\nDue to the severity of the threat, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added\nCVE-2026-1281\nto its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.\nThreat actors are accelerating operations, moving from initial reconnaissance to deploying dormant backdoors designed to maintain long-term access even after organizations apply patches.\nPalo Alto Networks\nCortex Xpanse\nhas identified the presence of over 4,400 EPMM instances in our telemetry.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 through the following products:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nand\nAdvanced DNS Security\nCortex Xpanse\nNext-Generation Firewall\nwith the\nAdvanced Threat Prevention\nsecurity subscription\nPalo Alto Networks also recommends referring to\nIvanti\u2019s security advisory\n, released in January 2026.\nIvanti recommends in their security advisory\nto apply either RPM 12.x.0.x or RPM 12.x.1.x, depending on their version. The RPMs are version-specific, not vulnerability-specific. No downtime is required to apply the patch, and Ivanti is not aware of any feature functionality impact with this patch. More details can be found in the\nInterim Guidance section\n.\nThe\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\ncan also be engaged to help with a compromise or to provide a proactive assessment to lower your risk.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nCVE-2026-1281\n,\nCVE-2026-1340\nDetails of CVE-2026-1281\nCVE-2026-1281 (CVSS 9.8) is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM. The vulnerability lies in legacy bash scripts used by the Apache web server to handle URL rewriting.\nThe vulnerable component in Ivanti EPMM uses Apache RewriteMap configurations that point to bash scripts located at\n/mi/bin/map-appstore-url\n. These scripts are designed to process URLs for the In-House Application Distribution feature.\nThe flaw is a specific type of code injection that uses bash\narithmetic expansion\n. The exploitation process works by tricking the bash script into evaluating a variable that contains a malicious command. This process consists of the following phases:\nInput manipulation\n: The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to an endpoint like\n/mifs/c/appstore/fob/....\nVariable pointing\n: The attacker sets the\nst\nparameter to the string\ntheValue\n(padded with spaces to meet length requirements). The script assigns this input to a variable named\ngStartTime\n.\nPayload injection\n: The attacker sets the\nh\nparameter to include the malicious command wrapped in an array index, such as\ngPath['sleep 5']\n. The script assigns this to the variable\ntheValue\n.\nExecution\n: The script attempts to compare\ngStartTime\n(which is now the string\ntheValue\n) against the current time using an arithmetic evaluation (\nif [[ ${theCurrentTimeSeconds} -gt ${gStartTime} ]]\n).\nExpansion\n: Because\ngStartTime\npoints to\ntheValue\n, bash resolves\ntheValue\n. Inside\ntheValue\n, the attacker has embedded a command substitution (the array index). Bash executes the command (e.g.,\nsleep 5\nor a reverse shell) while resolving the array index.\nDetails of CVE-2026-1340\nCVE-2026-1340 (CVSS 9.8) impacts the Ivanti Android File Transfer mechanism. Although the root cause (unsafe bash script usage) is the same as CVE-2026-12821, they reside in two distinct scripts (\nmap-appstore-url\nvs.\nmap-aft-store-url\n) handling different features. This vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to endpoints beginning with\n/mifs/c/aftstore/fob/\n.\nCurrent Scope of the Exploitation\nUnit 42 has observed widespread and mostly automated exploitation attempts of CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340.\nWe have seen the following command to target vulnerable Ivanti EPMM servers via the following URL pattern shown below in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Format of command targeting vulnerable Ivanti EPMM servers.\nMalware Download\nIn some instances, attackers attempted to bypass authentication on Ivanti's MobileIron platform and immediately download and run a second-stage payload (the\n/slt\nscript). This second stage typically installs a web shell, a cryptominer or a persistent backdoor to grant the attacker control of the appliance.\nFigure 2 below shows an example of the URL and subsequent commands seen during an attempt.\nFigure 2. URL and commands from an exploitation attempt.\nBotnet Activity\nWe observed attackers downloading a Nezha monitoring agent, an open-source server monitoring utility. They downloaded this tool with specific parameters to fetch from Gitee if the victim\u2019s location is China, ensuring the largest possible victim base irrespective of location. Figure 3 below shows the command to download the Nezha agent.\nFigure 3. Attempt to download a Nezha monitoring agent.\nReverse Shell Attempts\nIn many cases, we observed attempts to execute reverse shells by injecting commands establishing outbound connections to a listening post. Figure 4 below shows examples of these attempts.\nFigure 4. Attempts to execute reverse shells.\nReconnaissance\nWe also observed attackers issue sleep commands in attempts to determine whether the server targeted was vulnerable to exploitation. This is a simple method of testing if the server will pause for five seconds. If the connection hangs for exactly five seconds before returning an error (e.g., a 404 error), the attacker knows they have achieved RCE and will follow up immediately with malicious payloads. Figure 5 shows examples of commands for the reconnaissance attempts.\nFigure 5. Attempts at reconnaissance.\nWeb Shell Activity\nWe observed threat actors attempt to install a lightweight JSP web shell with names like\n401.jsp\n,\n403.jsp\nand\n1.jsp\nat filepath\n/mi/tomcat/webapps/mifs/\nacross various intended targets. In these cases, if the web server is running as\nroot\nor\nAdministrator\n, the attacker would gain administrative control of the server. Figure 6 below shows an example of these JSP web shells.\nFigure 6. Example of a decoded JSP web shell.\nInterim Guidance for CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340\nA January 2026\nIvanti security advisory\nrecommends their customers apply either RPM 12.x.0.x or RPM 12.x.1.x, depending on their version. Customers do not need to apply both RPMs as they are version-specific, not vulnerability-specific.\nNo downtime is required to apply this patch, and the company is not aware of any feature functionality impact with this patch.\nIvanti\u2019s recommendation remains the same: Customers who have not yet patched should do so immediately, and then review their appliance for any signs of exploitation that may have occurred prior to patching. Applying the patch is the most effective way to prevent exploitation, regardless of how IOCs change over time, especially once a POC is available. The patch requires no downtime and takes only seconds to apply.\nIvanti has provided customers with high\u2011fidelity indicators of compromise, technical analysis at disclosure, and an Exploitation Detection script developed with NCSC\u2011NL, and continues to support customers as they respond to this threat.\nUnit 42 Managed Threat Hunting Queries\nThe Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting team continues to track any attempts to exploit these CVEs across our customers, using Cortex XDR and the XQL queries below. Cortex XDR customers can also use these XQL queries to search for signs of exploitation.\nIf Ivanti EPMM logs are being ingested into Cortex XDR or XSIAM, the following query can be used to identify signs of exploitation. To do so, the dataset name will need to be specified within the dataset stage.\n//Description: This query identifies HTTP(S) requests logged within Ivanti EPMM (Formerly MobileIron) logs that match exploitation URI parameters.

While these types of attacks lack precision, successfully compromising unpatched edge devices at scale makes them high-risk assets unsecured by patching cycles alone. Organizations with internet-facing management interfaces should adopt an assumed breach mentality and treat detection of any indicators as potential compromise with possible deeper persistence and lateral movement.\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

The post Phishing on the Edge of the Web and Mobile Using QR Codes appeared first on Unit 42 .\n\nThreat Research Center\nThreat Research\nMalware\nMalware\nPhishing on the Edge of the Web and Mobile Using QR Codes\n15\nmin read\nRelated Products\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nCloud-Delivered Security Services\nUnit 42 Incident Response\nBy:\nDiva-Oriane Marty\nShehroze Farooqi\nAlex Starov\nPublished:\nFebruary 13, 2026\nCategories:\nMalware\nThreat Research\nTags:\nPhishing\nQR Codes\nSocial engineering\nShare\nExecutive Summary\nThis article explores the misuse of QR codes in today's threat landscape, covering three areas of concern:\nQR codes using URL shorteners to disguise malicious destinations\nQR codes using in-app deep links to steal account credentials and take control of a victim's apps\nQR codes attempting to bypass app store security by linking to direct downloads of malicious apps\nWith QR codes a notable presence in our everyday lives, some people instinctively scan them without hesitation. But QR codes are also a vector for attack. QR codes enable attackers to bypass organizational security by exploiting the weaker controls of personal mobile devices. By doing this, they can trick users into scanning codes and interacting with malicious destinations outside the corporate security perimeter.\nOver the past several months, we have tracked campaigns that used QR codes for phishing (known as quishing) and scams. Our telemetry reveals an average of over 11,000 detections of malicious QR codes each day. Investigating these detections, we found that attackers are leveraging QR code shorteners, in-app deep links and direct downloads to bypass people\u2019s awareness and security controls.\nIn addition to mass campaigns, we see attackers using QR codes for highly targeted messenger app phishing, such as\ntargeting Ukrainian Signal users\nin the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. These findings necessitate further analysis of deep links and QR code data.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats described in this article through the following products and services:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nPrisma Browser\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\n.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nQR Codes\n,\nPhishing\n,\nSocial Engineering\nPhishing QR Codes Not New, but a Growing Threat\nQR codes are not a new technology, but\ntheir prevalence\nhas increased with the push for contactless interactions, especially\nduring the initial emergency phase of the coronavirus pandemic\n. QR codes allow companies to interact seamlessly with their customer base for payments, enabling customers to join rewards programs and sign up for apps or mailing services. People have grown used to QR codes in daily life, and often scan them without sufficient caution, increasing their susceptibility to attacks.\nThe popularity of QR codes has led to their use by attackers. In our offline web crawlers, we currently find an average of 75,000 detections of QR codes each day, with 15% of these pages containing QR codes leading to malicious links. This represents an average of over 11,000 detections of malicious QR code use each day.\nProblem of Evasive QR Code Redirects\nWe looked beyond the recognized risks of QR codes. While straightforward QR code web-based attacks remain a threat, our focus shifted to understanding how attackers are leveraging the following trends to remain evasive to both victims and security controls:\nQR code shorteners\nIn-app deep links\n(special URLs that allow people to open specific content within a mobile app)\nDirect app file downloads\nThese tactics represent an evolution in QR code-based attacks that security teams need to address.\nPrevious\nUnit 42 research\nhas covered several key attack vectors for phishing QR codes hosted on documents, which are also relevant when hosted on websites. Attacks through these vectors can be effective for several reasons including:\nLower user vigilance\nSecurity solutions having difficulty extracting URLs embedded in QR codes\nComplex redirection chains that obscure final destinations\nWeaker security controls on personal mobile devices\nHosting on otherwise legitimate-looking pages\nBuilding upon this threat model, in-app deep links allow the attacker to target specific apps and trigger specific behavior (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. QR code threat model.\nQR codes on websites need to be analyzed by security crawlers and other security solutions. To close this security gap, specific QR code detection techniques must be deployed to analyze the various data types stored in QR codes:\nStandard HTTPS URLs\nDeep links\nNon-URL content (e.g., JSON, plaintext)\nKey Definitions\nQR code shorteners\nare services that combine a URL shortener with a QR code generator to create a shorter, more scannable QR code that links to a long URL. These shorteners offer benefits such as reducing the size of the QR code, allowing attackers to change the destination URL later, and tracking scan data in a single dashboard.\nIn-app deep links\nare\nhyperlinks that direct visitors to a specific screen or content within a mobile app\n. In-app deep links can use both custom URL schemes (i.e.,\nsms:+1234567890:Hello, tg[:]//login?token=\n) or standard web URLs (i.e.,\nhxxps[:]//wa[.]me/settings/linked_devices#\n) that the operating system redirects to the app.\nFigure 2 shows an example that displays a phishing site impersonating a job match and training program website that hosts a payment in-app deep link. Deep links are often used to improve user experience by reducing the number of steps to access specific content from external sources like emails, social media, authentication tokens or ads.\nFigure 2. QR code in-app deep link example.\nThe Stealth Factor: QR Code Shorteners\nAttackers use QR code shorteners to mask malicious destinations. QR code shorteners convert a static image into a dynamic endpoint. Consequently, the attacker can change the redirect destination at will.\nThe attacker is also able to leverage the good reputation of QR code shortener services to evade detection of malicious activity. Even security-conscious people who check the URL preview before scanning cannot determine the final destination when presented with shortened links. This technique effectively prevents targets from being aware of potential threats until after the malicious payload has been delivered.\nOur previous article has already talked about the\nrisk of URL shorteners\nmore broadly. However, the combination of a QR code and URL shortener is even more likely to bypass scrutiny.\nSteady Increase in QR Code Shortener Traffic\nWe have seen QR code shortener traffic grow steadily over the past three years (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. QR code shortener traffic trends, 2023-2025.\nWe see a steady increase of QR code shortener traffic in our telemetry. This includes a 55% increase from the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2024 and a 44% increase from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025. This data is based on the following popular QR code shortener services:\nqrcc[.]io\nqrco[.]de\nme-qr[.]com\nqr[.]io\nqrfy[.]com\nqrfy[.]io\nget-qr[.]com\nqr[.]ne, qrs[.]ly\nMost Misused QR Code Shortener Services\nOur telemetry reveals that\nqrco[.]de\n,\nme-qr[.]com\nand\nqrs[.]ly\nare the most used QR code shorteners. Compared to the top QR code shorteners mentioned in the\nAnti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) phishing trends report [PDF]\n,\nqrs[.]ly\nis a notable new addition as the QR code shortener used in 7.3% of the malicious URLs observed.\nTargeted Industries\nFinancial services was the most impacted industry when considering compromised QR code shorteners, accounting for 29% of this type of attack. This is followed by high tech (19%) and wholesale and retail (14%). Significantly, QR code shorteners for financial services make up only 4.8% of this type of traffic as a whole. This makes the high percentage of compromised QR code shorteners for financial services even more striking as shown in Figure 4\nFigure 4. This chart illustrates the contrast between the total QR code shorteners we observed in traffic, by industry, and the number of compromised QR code shorteners, by industry.\nExample of a Phishing Attack Misusing a QR Code Shortener\nThe webpage shown in Figure 5 is a popular file-sharing platform containing a QR code that appears to imitate a school by including its logo. Upon analysis, we found that it is a QR code shortener that first redirects to a CAPTCHA page and then lands on a phishing page that impersonates Outlook hosted on\ncdnimg.jeayacrai[.]in[.]net\n. After a few days, the URL from this QR code no longer worked, illustrating how QR code shorteners are often ephemeral and can quickly cease redirecting to the original malicious endpoint.\nFigure 5. Malicious QR code shortener example.\nIn-App Deep Links Vulnerabilities: More Than Just Web Browsing\nModern mobile devices support a wide range of QR code actions beyond simple web browsing. The distribution of in-app deep links in QR codes is an understudied area despite its exploitability. In-app deep links account for about three percent of the QR codes in our telemetry. Attackers can either misuse app functionality (e.g., adding a trusted device, or sending a payment), or push malicious content to those apps (such as, adding malicious links to calendar invites).\nDefenders face a challenge in detecting malicious in-app deep links embedded in QR codes because the activity generated by these links is often invisible to standard web crawlers. Effective detection necessitates a mobile sandbox environment with the specific app installed to properly observe and analyze this activity. Custom in-app deep links lack standardization across applications. This makes identifying malicious signals difficult to generalize, often requiring individualized investigation for each case.\nBoth iOS and Android devices can process QR codes with in-app deep links that have direct app integration. We categorize in-app deep links as those that apply to the following types of apps:\nSocial media and communications\nApp stores\nPayment\nSystem utilities (e.g., Wi-Fi, contacts, calendar, telephone, email, SMS, navigation)\nThe three most popular custom app URLs that we found were for Telegram, XHS Discover (RedNote) and Line, which respectively account for 44.7%, 1.8% and 0.8% of in-app deep links. As we discuss later, attackers commonly misuse Telegram and Line.\nAttack Scenarios\nIn-app deep links enable additional cross-device interactions, creating new attack scenarios via QR codes.\nTable 1 lists some examples of the attack chain scenarios possible through in-app deep links.\nAttack\nName\nDeep Link Category\nDescription\nExample (QR Code Content)\nFinancial fraud\nPayment\nDirect access to payment applications with pre-filled recipient information\nbitcoin:\nattackers_address\nAccount Takeover\nSocial Media and Communications\nDirects the victim to authenticate the attacker into the victim\u2019s account\nAttacker\u2019s website hosts\n:\ntg[:]//login?token=xxxx\nEmbedding Malicious URLs\nCommunications, Other Apps\nAttackers can embed malicious URLs in emails or text messages to be sent from the victim\u2019s device, saved into a file, etc.\nmailto[:]\nreceive@mail[.]com?subject=Request%5D&body=Please%20visit%20this%20website%20\nwww.malicious-url[.]com\n{info-here :\nwww.malicious-url[.]com\n}\nCalendar poisoning\nSystem utilities\nMalicious meeting links added to calendars that redirect victims to phishing sites when they attempt to join meetings,\nMalicious files\nadded to a calendar invite\nBEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 BEGIN:VEVENT SUMMARY:Team Lunch & Planning Session DTSTART:20251205T120000 DTEND:20251205T130000 LOCATION:\nwww.phishing-meeting-link-url[.]com\nDESCRIPTION:Discuss Q4 results and plan for Q1 goals.

Attack scenarios involving in-app deep links.\nMany of these attack scenarios involve embedding malicious URLs into specific data entries stored in mobile apps. Figure 6 illustrates this for contact poisoning, where a malicious URL is embedded in a saved contact card.\nFigure 6. Contact poisoning attack scenario.\nSome of the scenarios described in Table 1 were not observed in our data collection, while others were. The ones not observed are plausible, but hypothetical scenarios. We will further discuss the scenarios observed in our data collection below.\nCurrent Attack Trends and Examples\nFinancial Fraud In-App Deep Links\nFinancial in-app deep links represent a significant financial risk to potential victims. QR codes are commonly used in legitimate business transactions to facilitate payments, making it straightforward for attackers to misuse this trusted interaction through phishing schemes. We observed legitimate in-app deep links from popular payment apps such as:\nWeChat Pay\nAlipay\nBitcoin\nEthereum\nLitCoin\nMetamask\nTrust (wallet)\nThe familiarity and trust people have with payment-related QR codes create an ideal environment for social engineering attacks, where malicious QR codes can closely mimic legitimate payment requests. Phishing campaigns using pressure tactics can manipulate people into making quick payments.\nBelow, we share a few examples where an attacker attempts to trigger a financial transaction using a QR code. Figure 7 includes two examples. The first example is a phishing campaign claiming easy returns on investment, asking for an initial payment through a Bitcoin in-app deep link. The second example is a hacking for hire service advertising and providing easy payment with a WeChat payment in-app deep link.\nFigure 7. Examples of malicious financial in-app deep links.\nFigure 8 illustrates another get-rich-quick phishing scheme that requests an initial payment through a popular cryptocurrency wallet via a QR code with an in-app deep link.\nFigure 8. QR code phishing scheme that uses a popular cryptocurrency wallet.\nMessenger Account Takeover Through In-App Deep Links\nAccount takeovers through in-app deep links appear to be a significant phishing vector for messaging and social media sites. Telegram, in particular, was the most prominent application identified in our analysis that uses custom in-app deep links. We found over 35,000 QR codes that contain Telegram in-app deep links such as tg[:]//login or tg[:]//resolve and we observed multiple instances where attackers exploited these links to compromise accounts.\nWe saw three kinds of Telegram in-app deep links:\nLogin\nResolve\nProxy\nLogin accounted for 97% of the Telegram in-app deep links observed. Login grants the QR code creator authorization to access your account.\nPrevious reporting of\nTelegram in-app deep link scams\nwarns about these account takeover attacks. Roughly one out of every five host pages with a login Telegram in-app deep link is malicious, based on our conservative estimate.\nFigure 9 includes two examples of such Telegram login scams. However, while Telegram is the most popular, attackers are also targeting other popular communication apps.\nFigure 9. Example of a QR code designed to give an attacker full access to the device and account owner\u2019s Telegram.\nFigure 10 shows an example of a QR code containing an in-app deep link that requests authorization to a target's Line account. This would allow attackers to send Line messages under the device and account owner\u2019s name. Of note, Line has since deprecated this in-app deep link, and the link will now result in an error.\nFigure 10. Example of a QR code for a Line account takeover.\nFigure 11 shows an example of a QR code containing an in-app deep link that requests authorization to access a target's Signal account.\nFigure 11. Example of a QR code for a Signal account takeover.\nFigure 12 shows an example of a QR code containing an in-app deep link that requests authorization to access a target's WhatsApp account.\nFigure 12. Example of a QR code for a WhatsApp account takeover.\nIn addition to mass phishing campaigns, there's a clear trend toward more focused attacks aimed at stealing Signal credentials. For instance, the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG)\nhas documented increased efforts\nby Russia state-aligned actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts. These attacks frequently misuse Signal's\nfeature to link devices\nwith malicious QR codes.\nMany of these campaigns have targeted Ukraine in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. In July 2024, the CERT-UA reported on several threat groups, such as\nUAC-0185\n(aka UNC4221), that have specifically targeted messenger accounts.\nOur researchers continue to observe new malicious domains targeting Ukrainian Signal users, including snitch.open-group[.]site and similar variations. After linking a new session to Signal accounts, the attackers can exfiltrate message history and other account information. We have reported discovered information to our Ukrainian cybersecurity partners.\nFigure 13 shows a QR code from a campaign targeting Ukraine-based Signal accounts.\nFigure 13. QR code from a campaign targeting Ukraine-based Signal accounts.\nBypassing App Store Security: Direct App Downloads\nQR codes are widely used for easy downloading of files and applications. Attackers can exploit this convenience to trick victims into downloading malicious content or installing harmful mobile applications.\nMajor app stores impose strict security and compliance guidelines to limit the distribution of harmful apps. However, attackers may circumvent these security measures by distributing links to unreviewed Android Package Kit (APK) files hosted on their own servers via QR codes.\nOur investigation identified 59,000 detections of host pages distributing a total of 1,457 distinct APK files directly through QR codes, without going through any app store. Notable examples of these distributed APKs are listed below.\nGambling/Casino App Downloads\nGambling and casino games websites are distributing their apps through APK files in QR codes.\nFigures 14-16 illustrate some examples of such host pages. They are all hosted by many different domains and request certain Android permissions that could be concerning to people.\nFigure 14 shows an ad for a popular game that includes a QR code, which redirects the victim to another QR code to download\na game app\nnamed yicai.apk from \u200b\u200bf9999[.]app. This QR code is hosted on 10,022 unique URLs.\nThe app requests read and write permissions to the device's external storage and camera. It also requests install packages permissions.\nFigure 14. First example of a gambling game distribution campaign through a QR code.\nFigure 14 shows an ad for\nanother game\nhosted on 9,161 unique URLs. The URL used in Figure 15 is\nhxxps[:]//pyreneesakbash[.]com/m-nagapoker/android.html\n. The file for the game is named NagaPocker.apk, and it requests write to external storage and internet permissions.\nFigure 15. Second example of a gambling game distribution campaign through a QR code.\nFigure 16 shows\nan app\ndistributed through two different pages. Named\napp-u7cp-release.apk\n, the app requests:\nAccess to coarse location\nAccess to fine location\nBackground location\nRead and write access to external storage\nRead phone state\nCamera permissions\nFigure 16. Two different pages with QR codes leading to the same app.\nWarnings from\nTrustwave\nabout malicious APK files highlight that these types of gambling and betting apps expose victims to harmful activity, such as:\nExcessive advertising\nTheft of personal data\nTheft of funds\nHidden fees\nSubscriptions\nThese apps provide financial incentives for engagement, prolonging the life of such scams. Allowing victims to download apps directly and bypassing official app stores enables attackers to circumvent app verification procedures.\nMany campaigns hosting QR codes that pointed to a given APK file did so across numerous domains. The apps request suspicious Android permissions, most notably write external storage, camera and access fine location. These permissions could allow intentional data exfiltration, accidental data leakage and surveillance. The aggressive distribution across many different host pages, stealthy methods and excessive permissions suggest malicious intent.\nOther Malicious App Downloads\nThough gambling apps account for a large portion of the QR codes distributing APK files, QR codes also distribute other kinds of suspicious apps. Figure 17 illustrates two examples.\nFigure 17. Examples of QR code with malicious app downloads.\nThe\nfirst example\nis a phone optimization app named\nludashi_home.apk\n. It requests the following permissions:\nRecording audio\nReading battery status\nReading phone state\nAccessing the camera\nReading and writing to external storage\nAuthenticating accounts\nClearing the app cache\nInstalling packages permissions\nThe\nsecond example\nis a social network app for educators named\nk12sns.apk\n. This app also requests several different types of permissions:\nAccessing the internet\nReading logs\nWaking the lock\nReading the phone state\nWriting to external storage\nSeveral vendors detect these apps as suspicious or malicious, and they extract sensitive information from the device they are installed on. For example, the phone optimization app can take on certain behaviors like authenticating accounts and installing further packages, which attackers can misuse for malicious gains.\nConclusion\nThe attack scenarios and variety of examples we've discovered illustrate the extensive potential and existing prevalence of QR code misuse. The fundamental challenges of this type of misuse are user awareness and lack of visibility from current detection systems.\nMost people scanning QR codes don't anticipate the broad range of device functions that can be triggered from in-app deep links or unexpected endpoints from QR code shorteners. This expectation mismatch creates a significant security weak spot that attackers can actively exploit.\nUser education remains critical \u2014 people need to understand that QR codes can do much more than simply open webpages.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:\nCustomers using\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nand\nPrisma Browser\n(with Advanced Web Protection) are better protected against various QR code attacks.

The attackers breached the shared hosting provider\u2019s environment.\nThis allowed the attackers to intercept and redirect traffic destined for the Notepad++ update server. This infrastructure-level hijack enabled the attackers to selectively target specific users. The targets were primarily located in Southeast Asia across government, telecommunications and critical infrastructure sectors. Attackers served these targets malicious update manifests instead of legitimate software updates.\nWe\u2019ve identified additional unreported infrastructure, which is linked to this campaign. We\u2019ve observed two chains of infection including a Lua script injection variant that resulted in the delivery of Cobalt Strike beacon malware as well as DLL side-loading to deliver a Chrysalis backdoor. Unit 42 also found that this threat activity is targeting more sectors and more regions than previously reported.\nThis campaign also affected the following sectors in South America, the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia:\nCloud hosting\nEnergy\nFinancial\nGovernment\nManufacturing\nSoftware development\nNotepad++ is a lightweight, open-source code editor and text replacement utility. This tool is widely favored for its speed, extensive plugin ecosystem and unique ability to handle massive data files while persisting sessions that users have not yet saved.\nIn enterprise environments, Notepad++ often serves as a foundational instrument for system administrators, network engineers and DevOps personnel. These personnel commonly use this tool to modify server configurations, parse heavy system logs and audit code on secure jump boxes where heavier applications are impractical.\nThis specific user demographic makes Notepad++ a strategically critical target for threat actors. Compromising this single tool allows attackers to effectively bypass perimeter defenses and piggyback into the sessions of the most privileged users in the organization, gaining implicit administrative access to the network's core infrastructure.\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections from and mitigations for the activity discussed in this article in the following ways:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nand\nAdvanced DNS Security\nidentify known URLs and domains associated with this activity as malicious\nAdvanced WildFire\nmachine-learning models and analysis techniques have been reviewed and updated in light of the indicators shared in this research\nCortex Cloud\nhelps detect and prevent the malicious operations or configuration alterations or exploitations discussed within this article\nCortex XDR\nand\nXSIAM\nby employing the\nMalware Prevention Engine\nNext-Generation Firewall\nwith the\nAdvanced Threat Prevention\nis designed to defend networks against both commodity threats and targeted threats\nThe\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\ncan also be engaged to help with a compromise or to provide a proactive assessment to lower your risk.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nDLL Sideloading\n,\nBackdoors\n,\nSupply Chain\n,\nCobalt Strike\nDetails of the Attack on Notepad++\nThis supply chain attack relied on exploiting insufficient verification controls in older versions of the Notepad++ updater,\nWinGUp\n. This exploitation allowed the threat group to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers.\nWhen targeted victims attempted to update their software, they downloaded a malicious NSIS installer. This installer \u2014 often named\nupdate.exe\n\u2014 initiated a complex infection chain. This chain used DLL sideloading techniques and misused a legitimate Bitdefender component (\nBluetoothService.exe\n) to load a malicious library (\nlog.dll\n) that decrypted and executed a custom backdoor. In another infection chain, attackers\nutilized\nan NSIS installer to execute a command to run a malicious Lua script to load Cobalt Strike Beacon.\nThis malware, called\nChrysalis\n, employed advanced evasion techniques. These included:\nUsing Microsoft\nWarbird\ncode protection framework\nCustom API hashing to reduce antivirus detection\nEstablishing persistent remote control over infected systems\nAdditional Exploitation Activity in This Campaign\nUnit 42 observed evidence of two separate attack sequences:\nOne in which a malicious NSIS installer drops a compiled Lua script containing an installer to download and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload\nOne in which attackers used DLL side-loading to inject the Chrysalis backdoor into memory\nWe observed additional activity dating between mid-August and November 2025 that was consistent with this exploitation activity. In an August incident, we observed communication with a command-and-control (C2) IP address\n45.76.155[.]202\n. After days of C2 beacon traffic to this IP address, attackers shifted to a second C2 server at\n45.77.31[.]210\n, with communication lasting until September.\nIn cases between September and November 2025, we observed activity consistent with outbound connections to a C2 server. These were followed by subsequent download requests for\nupdate.exe\nthat are consistent with the reported Chrysalis backdoor. In some cases, download attempts were made to an IP address, whereas others were made to domains. Successful beacons to malicious servers occurred within seconds of successful download of the malicious payload and continued for an unspecified amount of time.\nIn September and October 2025, we observed a Lua script injection variant deploying malicious Lua scripts to inject shellcode. This attack used the\nEnumWindowStationsW\nAPI and resulted in the delivery of Cobalt Strike beacon malware. In this case, the download originated from:\n45.76.155[.]202/update/update.exe\nSeparately, we also observed a Bluetooth DLL sideloading variant in the same case. This Lua variant uses Bluetooth service DLL sideloading techniques to deploy the Chrysalis backdoor. Download attempts for this variant were made from a different malicious server:\n45.32.144[.]255/update/update.exe\nInterim Guidance\nNotepad++ recommends\nthe following:\nDownloading version 8.9.1, which includes the relevant security enhancement\nRunning the installer to update your Notepad++ manually\nAccording to Notepad++, they have migrated their website to a new hosting provider with significantly stronger security practices.\nWithin Notepad++ itself, they enhanced the WinGup updater in v8.8.9 to verify both the certificate and the signature of the downloaded installer.\nAdditionally, they also note:\nThe XML returned by the update server is now signed (XMLDSig)\nCertificate and signature verification will be enforced starting with the upcoming version 8.9.2, which they expect to release in about a month\nUnit 42 Managed Threat Hunting Queries\nThe Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting team continues to track any signs of misuse or anomalous activity, using Cortex XDR and the XQL queries below. Cortex XDR customers can also use these XQL queries to assist with their investigations or hunting.\nAs the majority of activity likely occurred prior to December 2, we recommend reviewing data retention limits to determine if these queries will be effective in your environment. If available in your environment, you may consider using \"cold storage\" queries (cold_dataset = xdr_data) to query data beyond hot retention limits. Please note that running queries against cold storage will consume compute units.\n// Name: DLL sideloading via BYO application\r\n\r\n// Description: Identifies renamed Bitdefender utility loading a

campaign marks a notable evolution in the operational tradecraft of threat actors of this type, representing a pivot from broad infrastructure pre-positioning to highly targeted \u201csoft\u201d supply chain interdiction. Recent campaigns from groups like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon have focused primarily on compromising critical infrastructure backbones and edge devices, relying on living-off-the-land techniques and minimal malware. This operation instead illuminates a distinct strategic priority of focusing on administrative keyholders.\nHijacking the traffic flow of a trusted utility rather than injecting code into the software build pipeline allowed the threat actors to weaponize their delivery mechanism without alerting the vendor. This adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) capability allowed for dynamic fingerprinting of incoming update requests, enabling for highly selective filtering of priority targets.\nThis campaign is not focused on disruption, but on long-term valuable intelligence. This is illustrated by the combination of the threat actor\u2019s selective victimology \u2014 focused on system administrators and developers in many geopolitically strategic regions \u2014 and their choice to use a lightweight backdoor with a low-profile.\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members. CTA members use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt malicious cyber actors.

The patterns created could identify threat actors by behavior. The post Novel Technique to Detect Cloud Threat Actor Operations appeared first on Unit 42 .\n\nThreat Research Center\nThreat Research\nCloud Cybersecurity Research\nCloud Cybersecurity Research\nNovel Technique to Detect Cloud Threat Actor Operations\n19\nmin read\nRelated Products\nCortex\nCortex Cloud\nUnit 42 Cloud Security Assessment\nUnit 42 Incident Response\nBy:\nNathaniel Quist\nPublished:\nFebruary 6, 2026\nCategories:\nCloud Cybersecurity Research\nThreat Research\nTags:\nAPI\nIAM\nMITRE\nMuddled Libra\nSilk Typhoon\nShare\nExecutive Summary\nCloud-based alerting systems often struggle to distinguish between normal cloud activity and targeted malicious operations by known threat actors. The difficulty doesn\u2019t lie in an inability to identify complex alerting operations across thousands of cloud resources or in a failure to follow identity resources, the problem lies in the accurate detection of known persistent threat actor group techniques specifically within cloud environments.\nIn this research, we hypothesize how a new method of alert analysis could be used to improve detection. Specifically, we look at cloud-based alerting events and their mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK\n\u00ae\ntactics and techniques they represent. We believe that we can show a correlation between threat actors and the types of techniques they use, which will trigger specific types of alerting events within victim environments. This distinct, detectable pattern could be used to identify when a known threat actor group compromises an organization.\nTo prove this method of alert analysis, Unit 42 researchers focused on two known threat actor groups that use two fundamentally different types of operational techniques to compromise their victims\u2019 cloud environments. These groups are the cybercrime group\nMuddled Libra\nand the nation-state group\nSilk Typhoon\n. Both threat actor groups are known to target cloud operations.\nWe analyzed cloud alerting events across 22 industries between June 2024 and June 2025.\nThe research was conducted by pairing the cloud-related MITRE ATT&CK techniques known to be used by Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon with the specific security alerts they are known to trigger in cloud environments.\nThe test confirmed, as you will see within the remainder of this article, that security teams can successfully distinguish unique alerting patterns between Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon based solely on the types of alerts observed.\nAdditionally, the results show a clear link between threat actors\u2019 cloud-focused operations and the industries those groups target. Therefore, at times when one of the groups was known to be attacking certain industries, we can see those patterns appear in our data.\nThe confirmation that our detection method works as expected opens the door to the possibility of automated prevention capabilities for complex cloud architectures.\nCortex Cloud is designed to detect and prevent the malicious operations, configuration alterations and exploitations discussed in this article, by associating events with MITRE tactics and techniques. These capabilities help organizations to maintain runtime detection of events.\nOrganizations can gain help assessing cloud security posture through the\nUnit 42 Cloud Security Assessment\n.\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\n.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nMuddled Libra\n(related to\nScattered Spider\n)\n,\nAPI\n,\nIAM\nAnother Lens on Cloud Alert Trends\nFollowing our previous article on\ncloud alert trends\n, we conducted another analysis of cloud alert statistics.\nAs part of the effort to determine whether we could identify threat groups, this time we analyzed the data in terms of the industries in which cloud alerts were triggered. Adding industry telemetry to the analysis allowed us to focus our efforts on identifying the techniques, and thus the resulting alerts, used by these threat actors as a control parameter. Using alert data pulled between June 2024 and June 2025, we identified the industries that saw the highest number of unique alert types as well as the highest average number of daily alerts. We then correlated these trends with the activities and targets of two threat groups: Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon.\nThis article presents our analysis of Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon operational techniques and the associated alert analysis.\nGlossary: Mapping Techniques to Alerts\nThe research was conducted by analyzing cloud-related MITRE ATT&CK techniques known to be used by Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon and pairing them with the specific security alerts they are known to trigger in cloud environments. The following glossary will assist readers in understanding the results we present.\nMapping MITRE Techniques to Alerts:\nA single MITRE technique can potentially trigger multiple unique security alerts, and conversely, a single alert can map to one or more MITRE techniques and tactics. For example, the alert\nRemote command line usage of serverless function\u2019s token\nin the Cortex Cloud platform correlates to the MITRE tactic\nCredential Access\n, and the MITRE techniques\nSteal Application Access Token\nand\nUnsecured Credentials\n.\nUnique Alert Count:\nWe counted each alert rule only once for the basis of this research. For example, we identified nearly 70 different unique alerting rules that could be attributed to at least one of the 11 different cloud-related MITRE techniques known to be used by Muddled Libra. For Silk Typhoon, we found just over 50 unique alerting rules that could be attributed to at least one of their 12 known cloud-related MITRE techniques. Additionally, we found that only three unique alert rules were present in both Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon alert rule sets. In some cases, these alerting rules triggered multiple times within our data across multiple organizations, but when we refer to unique alerts within an industry, we are only considering whether an alert triggered at all during the specified period.\nAverage Daily Occurrences:\nIf a threat actor used the MITRE technique\nData from Cloud Storage\n(T1530), one of the resulting unique Cortex alert rules might be\nSuspicious identity downloaded multiple objects from a bucket\n. If this alert is triggered 1,000 times in a single day, it counts as a single unique alert, but the 1,000 occurrences of that alert in that day will be calculated in the average daily occurrences. When we report average alerts per day by industry in the article below, we take the average for each organization within that industry vertical.\nTo use a metaphor to help explain how we considered alerts, if each alert rule was a type of fruit, we would see that Muddled Libra holds a very different basket of fruit than Silk Typhoon does. In fact, the baskets are so diverse, that out of the nearly 70 different types of fruit Muddled Libra has, and the more than 50 different types of fruit Silk Typhoon has, they only have 3 types of fruit in common.\nWhen we look at alerts triggered within an industry, we might see a variety of fruit scattered about \u2014 maybe 10 oranges, 14 lemons and so on. When we analyze the fruit trail in terms of the types of fruit found within a particular industry, compared with the types of fruit found in the baskets we know Muddled Libra or Silk Typhoon to be holding, we can make a reasonable determination of which threat actor was involved.\nMethodology\nWe collected alerts between June 2024 and June 2025 that were triggered on a combination of platforms, including:\nCloud service providers\nContainer environments\nCloud-hosted applications\nSaaS platforms\nWe then analyzed the alerts based on their unique naming, originating platform, alert date and metadata such as:\nIndustry\nRegion\nFrequency of occurrence\nAverage number of occurrences in each organization\nAs described above, we integrated the correlation of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, by pairing each alert with its corresponding MITRE technique.\nWe also analyzed the correlation between the targeted organization\u2019s industry and region and the severity level of the alerts they experienced. This helped to identify the types of alerts that are more likely to occur, based on these factors.\nThreat Actor Profiles\nMuddled Libra\nBackground\nMuddled Libra\n(also known as Scattered Spider, or UNC3944) is a cybercrime group that has been active since 2021.\nKnown for its use of\nsocial engineering\n, including making calls to organizations\u2019 help desks, Muddled Libra has also been known to partner with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs. By continually\nupdating its approach\n, the group has successfully used social engineering techniques, including smishing (SMS phishing), vishing (voice phishing) and spear phishing (directly targeting an employee).\nUpon successfully compromising an organization, the group uses several tools, including ransomware variants such as\nDragonForce\n\u2013 a subscription-based RaaS framework created by a group of the same name, tracked by Unit 42 as Slippery Scorpius. The group also\nuses cloud enumeration tools\nsuch as\nADRecon\n, an open source Active Directory reconnaissance tool.\nTargeted Industries and Techniques\nWhile\nMuddled Libra\u2019s\ntargeted industries have evolved since 2022, the following sectors have been consistently reported:\nAerospace and defense\nFinancial services\nHigh technology\nHospitality\nMedia and entertainment\nProfessional and legal services\nTelecommunications\nTransportation and logistics\nWholesale and retail\nMuddled Libra employs multiple offensive\ntechniques\nto compromise and maintain access within a victim\u2019s environment. We analyzed the group\u2019s known techniques, and extracted those techniques that specifically focus on cloud infrastructure, as Table 1 shows. Together, these form a sort of \u201cfingerprint\u201d that we can use to identify the group within cloud alert data.\nMITRE Tactics\nMITRE Techniques\nMITRE Technique Name\nCollection\nT1530\nData from Cloud Storage\nDefense Evasion\nT1578.002\nModify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Create Cloud Instance\nDefense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access\nT1078.004\nValid Accounts: Cloud Accounts\nDiscovery\nT1069.003\nPermission Groups Discovery: Cloud Groups\nDiscovery\nT1087.004\nAccount Discovery: Cloud Account\nDiscovery\nT1526\nCloud Service Discovery\nDiscovery\nT1538\nCloud Service Dashboard\nDiscovery\nT1580\nCloud Infrastructure Discovery\nLateral Movement\nT1021.007\nRemote Services: Cloud Services\nPersistence, Privilege Escalation\nT1098.001\nAccount Manipulation: Additional Cloud Credentials\nPersistence, Privilege Escalation\nT1098.003\nAccount Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles\nTable 1. Known Muddled Libra cloud tactics and techniques.\nMethodology Walkthrough\nEven though each MITRE Technique is relatively granular in terms of scope of operation, there can be multiple types of computational events from a cloud platform or software-as-a-service (SaaS) application which can fall under the purview or scope of a single MITRE technique.\nFor example, the MITRE technique\nT1078.004 - Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts\nis focused on the operational event of a valid cloud account. This can have a wide scope in the types of event which can be counted, such as:\nUnusual resource modification from a newly seen IAM user\nDeletion of multiple cloud resources by a newly created IAM role\nA suspicious identity created or updated password for an IAM user\nEach of these can be linked to a valid cloud account but each one could have vastly different root causes.\nAdditionally, when looking specifically at an individual alert type, such as\nUnusual resource modification from a newly created IAM role\n, this event could be considered to align not only with the MITRE tactic Initial Access, but it could also align with the MITRE tactics Defense Evasion or even Persistence.\nWhen we expanded our scope to include potential alerting events that could be triggered by any of the MITRE techniques known to be used by Muddled Libra, we found nearly 70 alerting events that could be attributed to at least one of these MITRE techniques.\nWe collected all of these alerts, which were associated with each of the MITRE techniques known to be used by Muddled Libra. We then distilled those alerts to identify the number of unique alerts that were present within each industry. We also tracked the number of average daily occurrences for each organization within those industries. To use our fruit analogy, we identified the number of unique fruit that the threat actors left at each respective industry (unique alerts), then we also counted how many of each fruit type were present at each organization within that industry (average alert count).\nAs explained in the\nGlossary\nsection, we were able to use these numbers to build patterns.\nIndustry and Technique Analysis\nComparing the triggered alerts and their associated MITRE techniques with the targeted industries shows a correlation between the industries targeted according to public reports and the alerts triggered by Muddled Libra operations. Figure 1 shows this correlation by ranking industries from the highest to the lowest based on the number of unique alerts related to the MITRE techniques listed within Table 1, between June 2024 and July 2025. Industries that were publicly reported as targeted are shown in red.\nFigure 1. Count of unique alerts by industry from June 2024-June 2025. Red bars indicate the industries publicly reported as targeted by Muddled Libra.\nFigure 2 shows the average daily number of alerts that occurred during the same timeframe.\nFigure 2. Count of the average daily alerts by industry from June 2024-June 2025. Red bars indicate the industries publicly reported as targeted by Muddled Libra.\nFigure 2. Count of the average daily alerts by industry from June 2024-June 2025. Red bars indicate the industries publicly reported as targeted by Muddled Libra.\nWhile the highest volume of unique alerts (shown in Figure 1) aligns perfectly with Muddled Libra\u2019s most-reported targets \u2014 specifically high technology, wholesale and retail, financial, and professional and legal services\u2014the presence of a number of signature alerts in other sectors shouldn't be ignored. When an industry like manufacturing or pharma and life sciences or state and local government shows a significant subset of Muddled Libra\u2019s \"fingerprint\" (for instance, 16 or more unique alert types), it suggests the group could have an active interest in these environments even if we haven\u2019t seen headlines about it. Security teams in these \"middle-tier\" industries should treat these clusters of unique alerts as early warning signs that these industries are witnessing a significant number of the group's known operational techniques.\nThe unique alert data (Figure 1) should be considered alongside average daily alert data (Figure 2) to distinguish between a threat actor\u2019s strategic breadth and their operational persistence. For instance, transportation and logistics serves as a primary example of high-intensity targeting; it ranks sixth in unique alert variety but first in average daily volume, showing a 25% spike in unique alerts in June 2025 alone. This combination indicates that Muddled Libra is not only using a wide array of its signature techniques in this sector but is doing so with higher frequency. We will take a deeper dive into transportation and logistics in the next section.\nIn contrast, telecommunications and media and entertainment were some of the first and most frequent targets of Muddled Libra in 2022 and 2023, but their standings as the last two positions for average daily alerts in 2024-2025 suggest that these two industries in particular have experienced a saturation effect. Namely, the targeting of these groups may be aging off. They no longer appear to be the key focus of the Muddled Libra actors. The other industries that could also fall into this category are hospitality and aerospace and defense.\nFor a defender, this data provides a threshold for proactive investigation. A high count of unique alerts (the \"variety\" of the fruit basket) typically signals a sophisticated, multi-stage intrusion attempt, whereas a high daily average (the \"quantity\" of fruit) may point to automated scanning or persistent credential stuffing. If your organization sees more than 10 unique Muddled Libra-associated alerts within a 30-day window, it is time to look deeper, regardless of whether your specific industry is currently \"trending\" in threat intelligence circles. The goal is to move from reactive patching to proactive defense by identifying these actor-specific patterns before they escalate to data exfiltration.\nFocused Analysis: Aviation\nReports that Muddled Libra was\ntargeting the aviation industry\ninitially surfaced in June 2025. Unit 42 does not track aviation as a singular category. Instead, aviation organizations appear under our transportation and logistics category.\nWhen looking at the transportation and logistics industry alerts, we found an increase in the number of unique alerts based on the MITRE techniques used by Muddled Libra during this same timeframe.\nIt is important to note that here we are looking at the number of unique alert rules for this analysis and breaking this out by month, as opposed to the whole year view shown in Figure 1. We arrive at \u201cunique alerts\u201d for the industry by taking the average number of unique alerts seen for each organization tracked in that category over a monthly timeframe.\nFigure 3 shows that the average number of unique alerts per organization in the transportation industry increased by 25% from May-June 2025. What makes this finding important is that Muddled Libra made several headlines during June 2025 for its operations targeting airline organizations.\nFigure 3. Unique alerts by month for the transportation industry. The bar for June is red because it is the period publicly reported to have the highest targeting of the aviation industry.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, June 2025 saw the highest number of unique alerts for the transportation industry, with 15 unique alerts.\nThe Verdict on the Fingerprinting Effort\nLooking at the correlation, there does appear to be a fingerprint capability that could be used as a detection pattern. This pattern could help organizations identify if they are potentially targeted and take mitigative steps. Additionally, this could also assist organizations in developing an early warning detection trigger. For example, if defenders witness an increase in the number of daily average occurrences alerts from known Muddled Libra techniques, this could indicate reconnaissance or discovery activity occurring against their infrastructure. This then provides an opportunity to proactively prepare for future operations.\nTop 10 Alerts from Muddled Libra Techniques\nTable 2 lists the top 10 alerts that we observed in association with Muddled Libra\u2019s MITRE techniques.\nAlert Names\nMITRE Techniques\nTactics\nAzure sensitive resources enumeration activity using Microsoft Graph API\nT1526\nDiscovery\nMicrosoft 365 storage services exfiltration activity\nT1530\nCollection, Exfiltration\nMulti region enumeration activity\nT1580\nT1535\nT1526\nDiscovery\nStorage enumeration activity\nT1619\nT1530\nT1526\nDiscovery, Collection\nCloud Identity Queried Cost or Usage Information\nT1087.004\nT1580\nDiscovery\nA cloud identity invoked IAM related persistence operations\nT1098\nT1136\nT1078.004\nDefense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access\nCloud infrastructure enumeration activity\nT1580\nT1526\nDiscovery\nSuspicious identity downloaded multiple objects from a bucket\nT1530\nT1020\nCollection, Exfiltration\nSuspicious cloud infrastructure enumeration activity\nT1580\nT1526\nDiscovery\nML model discovery\nT1526\nDiscovery\nTable 2. The top 10 alerts associated with Muddled Libra\u2019s MITRE techniques.\nAs outlined in Table 2, Muddled Libra has an extensive history of targeting Microsoft Azure\nenvironments\nusing\nGraph API\n, a RESTful API that enables access to Azure cloud resources. This type of activity correlates with the MITRE techniques used by Muddled Libra and the alerts triggered by their operations. The most frequent alert between June 2024 and June 2025, in relation to the MITRE techniques used by Muddled Libra, was resource enumeration using Microsoft Graph API. The next most common alert was for exfiltration activity from Microsoft 365 storage services. While discovery operations represented the bulk of the remaining alert types, collection and exfiltration operations were the second most frequent alert type.\nSilk Typhoon\nBackground\nSilk Typhoon (also known as\nHAFNIUM\n) is a China-nexus threat actor group that has been in operation since at least 2021. This group has historically\nexploited\nmultiple vulnerabilities on Microsoft Exchange Servers. In recent years, the group appears to be shifting targets towards\ncloud environments\n, using compromised credentials obtained via vulnerable public-facing VPN endpoints to move laterally through cloud environments. The group relies on remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools to maintain persistent access and leverages Microsoft\u2019s Graph API to enumerate cloud resources.\nTargeted Industries and Techniques\nCybersecurity researchers have identified that the industries most commonly targeted, primarily located within the U.S., include:\nEducation\nHigh technology\nFederal governments\nFinancial services\nNongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\nProfessional and legal services\nState and local governments\nUtilities and energy\nSilk Typhoon has employed several offensive\ntechniques\nto compromise and maintain access within a victim\u2019s environment. Using the same methodology that was employed during the Muddled Libra analysis above, we analyzed the techniques and identified those that focus on cloud infrastructure, as Table 3 shows. We found that between Silk Typhoon and Muddled Libra\u2019s known employed technique usage, only three techniques were employed by both threat actor groups, T1530, T1078.004 and T1098.001. This provides a basis on which to compare and contrast the results between both groups\u2019 operations and, more importantly, on the types of alerts witnessed by organizations in the industries they target.\nMITRE Tactics\nMITRE Techniques\nMITRE Technique Name\nCollection\nT1119\nAutomated Collection\nCollection\nT1530\nData from Cloud Storage\nCredential Access\nT1555.006\nCredentials from Password Stores: Cloud Secrets Management Stores\nDefense Evasion,\nLateral Movement\nT1550.001\nUse Alternate Auth Material: Application Access Token\nDefense Evasion,\nPersistence,\nPrivilege Escalation,\nInitial Access\nT1078.004\nValid Accounts: Cloud Accounts\nDiscovery\nT1619\nCloud Storage Object Discovery\nExfiltration\nT1567.002\nExfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\nImpact\nT1485\nData Destruction\nInitial Access\nT1190\nExploit Public-Facing Application\nInitial Access\nT1199\nTrusted Relationship\nPersistence\nT1136.003\nCreate Account: Cloud Account\nPersistence,\nPrivilege Escalation\nT1098.001\nAccount Manipulation: Additional Cloud Credentials\nTable 3. Known Silk Typhoon cloud tactics and techniques.\nMethodology Walkthrough\nAs a brief recap to the methodology of our research, we analyzed the types of alerting events that could be associated with each of the MITRE Techniques known to be used by Silk Typhoon. When we included potential alerting events that could be triggered by any of the MITRE Techniques known to be used by Silk Typhoon, we found just over 50 alerting events that could be attributed to at least one of these MITRE Techniques.\nWe collected all of these alerts and distilled those alerts to identify the number of unique alerts that were present within each industry and the number of average daily occurrences of those alerts for each organization within those industries.\nTo use the same analogy as above, we wanted to identify what types of fruit Silk Typhoon brought to the party, and how many pieces of fruit they typically deploy when attacking.\nIndustry and Technique Analysis\nWe compared the total number of unique alerts for each month from June 2024 to June 2025 with the industries from which those alerts were triggered. This comparison confirmed that we were able to see the \u201cfingerprints\u201d of Silk Typhoon in the alerts triggered in industries that the group was known to be targeting.\nAs mentioned, Silk Typhoon had just over 50 unique alerts associated with their known technique usage, where Muddled Libra had nearly 70.\nIn contrast, we saw higher numbers of unique alerts within each industry when examining our Silk Typhoon data than we did in our Muddled Libra data.\nIn other words, Silk Typhoon may be holding a basket with fewer types of fruit (50) than in Muddled Libra\u2019s (70), but the threat actor seems to use more types from the basket in its operations (i.e. as many as 27 unique alerts as opposed to 22).\nThe graph in Figure 4 shows our observations of alerts by industry over the period studied.\nFigure 4. Count of unique alerts and average daily alerts by industry. Red bars indicate the industries public reported as targeted by Silk Typhoon.\nFigure 5. Count of the average daily alerts by industry. Red bars indicate the industries publicly reported as targeted by Silk Typhoon.\nWhile the highest volume of unique alerts aligns with Silk Typhoon\u2019s most-reported targets\u2014specifically high technology, financial services, and professional and legal services\u2014the presence of signature alerts in other sectors is equally telling. When an industry like wholesale and retail or manufacturing shows a significant subset of Silk Typhoon\u2019s \"fingerprint\" (for instance, 18 or more unique alert types), it indicates that the group could be actively deploying their offensive techniques against these industry environments. This could be occurring even if public reporting is minimal or nonexistent at this date. Security teams in these \"middle-tier\" industries should treat these clusters of unique alerts as evidence that they are witnessing a broad spectrum of the group's known operational techniques, rather than isolated incidents.\nThe unique alert data for Silk Typhoon (Figure 4) should be considered alongside average daily alert data (Figure 5) to distinguish between a threat actor\u2019s strategic breadth and their operational persistence. To return to our metaphor, Silk Typhoon holds a \"basket\" with fewer types of fruit (50) than Muddled Libra (70), but they tend to use more of what is in their basket at any given time. For example, we witnessed as many as 27 unique alerts in a single sector compared to Muddled Libra\u2019s 22.\nThe federal government serves as a primary example for high-intensity targeting. This industry ranks last in the number of unique alerts, or rather in variety, ie. the \"types of fruit\" in its basket, but first in average daily volume, peaking at 7.28 alerts per day (the \"quantity of fruits witnessed\"). This suggests that while Silk Typhoon may use a narrower set of techniques against government targets, it deploys those specific tactics with relentless frequency. Conversely, high technology shows a \"worst-of-both-worlds\" scenario, ranking first in unique tactical variety and near the top for daily volume. This indicates campaigns that are both sophisticated and persistent.\nSimilar to our comments on unique alerts, when we see a high level of activity possibly related to the threat group, it may be worth defenders' threat hunting for other known alerts related to Silk Typhoon, out of an abundance of caution. High levels of average alert activity could signify threat groups trying to gain initial access, but not yet succeeding in deploying their full toolset.\nFor a defender, this data provides a threshold for proactive investigation: a high count of unique alerts (the \"variety\" of the fruit basket) typically signals a sophisticated, multi-stage intrusion attempt, whereas a high daily average (the \"quantity\" of fruit) may point to automated scanning or persistent exploitation of specific vulnerabilities. If an organization observes more than 10 unique Silk Typhoon-associated alerts within a month, it is time to look deeper, regardless of whether a specific sector is making headlines as a common target.\nTop 10 Alerts from Silk Typhoon Techniques\nTable 4 lists the alerts most commonly seen in relation to the MITRE techniques used by Silk Typhoon.\nAlert\nNames\nMITRE\nTechniques\nTactics\nMicrosoft O365 storage services exfiltration activity\nT1530\nCollection, Exfiltration\nProcess execution with a suspicious command line indicative of the Spring4Shell exploit\nT1190\nInitial Access\nStorage enumeration activity\nT1619\nDiscovery\nA cloud identity invoked IAM related persistence operations\nT1098\nPersistence, Privilege Escalation\nSuspicious identity downloaded multiple objects from a bucket\nT1530\nT1020\nCollection, Exfiltration\nSuspicious identity downloaded multiple objects from a backup storage bucket\nT1530\nT1020\nCollection, Exfiltration\nAn identity performed a suspicious download of multiple cloud storage objects\nT1530\nT1020\nCollection, Exfiltration\nAn identity performed a suspicious download of multiple cloud storage objects from multiple buckets\nT1530\nT1020\nCollection, Exfiltration\nMassive code file downloads from SaaS service\nT1530\nCollection\nDeletion of multiple cloud resources\nT1485\nImpact\nTable 4. The top 10 alerts associated with Silk Typhoon\u2019s MITRE techniques.\nAs outlined in Table 4, collection and exfiltration techniques were the most common alerts associated with Silk Typhoon\u2019s MITRE techniques. Microsoft 365 storage services exfiltration was the most frequently observed alert. Other alerts identified include cloud storage enumerations and suspicious downloads of cloud storage objects.\nIndustry Cloud Alert Trends\nPerhaps the most striking result of our research came to light when we compared general cloud alerting trends with the trends we discovered while performing the fingerprinting analysis of Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon.\nThe industry of high technology was consistently the top ranked industry when considering general cloud alerting trends, as well as the two threat actor groups\u2019 alerting trends. However, the remaining industries we studied did not follow a uniform pattern. As shown in Figure 6, we found that the order of the most targeted industries shifted when we only counted alerts from Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon operations.\nFigure 6. Ranking of the top industries by unique alert counts for all alerts, Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon.\nAs stated above, the high technology industry is in first place across both threat actor group findings, as well as the top ranking industry when looking at all cloud alerts by industry.\nHowever, the remaining industry ranks do not mirror the same results. Looking at the wholesale retail industry illustrates a key finding. This industry is the second highest for Muddled Libra alerting events and third highest for Silk Typhoon, but is 14th on the industry list for all alerts.\nThis indicates that the fingerprinting analysis on these alerting operations does not reflect the same pattern as the general noise of all alerting trends. It appears that the distinct operations performed by the threat actors against the industries they target carry their own unique trends.\nConclusion\nOur analysis confirms the capacity to leverage the alerts triggered as a fingerprint detection pattern for the malicious techniques used by Muddled Libra and Silk Typhoon. This distinct detection capacity offers a new pathway for organizations to implement predictive and proactive cloud defense strategies.\nOur research successfully differentiated the MITRE tactic and technique operations used by Muddled Libra, notably the aviation industry\u2019s 25% increase in the number of unique alerts compared to the previous month, and Silk Typhoon\u2019s increased higher than average number of daily alerts within the Federal and State Government industry.\nBy identifying the alert patterns that each threat actor\u2019s techniques have on the alerting events within cloud environments, threat researchers can identify the threat actors most likely to target certain industries using specific techniques. This can then help defenders to proactively prepare defenses against those types of threats. Through the analysis of threats based on the types of attack techniques they leverage, organizations can create a defense methodology built specifically for their industry vertical.\nProper implementation of these defense controls can be effective in defending against targeted threat actor scenarios through the creation of tailored defensive alerting. Additionally, these controls can provide the capability to detect early warning scenarios and techniques, such as initial access operations, enabling prevention operations to block malicious cloud operations before they escalate to execution, impact or exfiltration.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:\nCortex Cloud customers can help secure and protect their cloud environments through compliance guardrails, application security monitoring and prevention techniques and through the proper placement of Cortex Cloud\nXDR endpoint agent\nand\nserverless agents\nwithin a cloud environment.

We refer to the group\u2019s activity as the Shadow Campaigns. We assess with high confidence that TGR-STA-1030 is a state-aligned group that operates out of Asia. Over the past year, this group has compromised government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries. This means that approximately one out of every five countries has experienced a critical breach from this group in the past year. Further, between November and December 2025, we observed the group conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries.\nThis group primarily targets government ministries and departments. For example, the group has successfully compromised:\nFive national-level law enforcement/border control entities\nThree ministries of finance and various other government ministries\nDepartments globally that align with economic, trade, natural resources and diplomatic functions\nGiven the scale of compromise and the significance of these organizations, we have notified impacted entities and offered them assistance through responsible disclosure protocols.\nHere we describe the technical sophistication of the actors, including the phishing and exploitation techniques, tooling and infrastructure used by the group. We provide defensive indicators to include infrastructure that is active at the time of this publication. Further, we explore an in-depth look at victimology by region with the intent of demonstrating the suspected motivations of the group. The results indicate that this group prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.\nAdditionally, we have also pre-shared these indicators with industry peers to ensure robust cross-industry defenses against this threat actor.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats described in this article through products and services, including:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nand\nAdvanced DNS Security\nAdvanced WildFire\nAdvanced Threat Prevention\nCortex XDR\nand\nXSIAM\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\n.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nAsia\n,\nPhishing\nActor Introduction\nUnit 42 first identified TGR-STA-1030 (aka UNC6619) upon investigating a cluster of malicious phishing campaigns (referred to here as the Shadow Campaigns) targeting European governments in early 2025. We use the prefix\nTGR-STA\nas a placeholder to denote a temporary group of state-aligned activity while we continue to refine attribution to a specific organization.\nSince our initial investigation, we have identified actor infrastructure dating as far back as January 2024, suggesting that the group has been active for at least two years. Over the past year, we have monitored the evolution and expansion of the group as it has compromised:\nFive national-level law enforcement/border control entities\nThree ministries of finance and various other government ministries\nDepartments globally that align with economic, trade, natural resources and diplomatic functions\nWe assess with high confidence that TGR-STA-1030 is a state-aligned group that operates out of Asia. We base this assessment on the following findings:\nFrequent use of regional tooling and services\nLanguage setting preferences\nTargeting and timing that routinely align with events and intelligence of interest to the region\nUpstream connections to operational infrastructure originating from the region\nActor activity routinely aligning with GMT+8\nAdditionally, we found that one of the attackers uses the handle \u201cJackMa,\u201d which could refer to the billionaire businessman and philanthropist who co-founded Alibaba Group and Yunfeng Capital.\nPhishing\nIn February 2025, Unit 42 investigated a cluster of malicious phishing campaigns targeting European governments. These campaigns followed a pattern of being sent to government email recipients with a lure of a ministry or department reorganization and links to malicious files hosted on\nmega[.]nz\n. Figure 1 below shows an example.\nFigure 1. Example phishing email (translated).\nClicking on the link downloads an archive file with language and naming that is consistent with the targeted country and ministry.\nWe assess that an Estonian government entity identified the campaign and uploaded one such\nZIP archive\nto a public malware repository. In this case, the Estonian filename was:\nPolitsei- ja Piirivalveameti organisatsiooni struktuuri muudatused.zip\nThis translates to\nChanges to the organizational structure of the Police and Border Guard Board.zip\nDiaoyu Loader\nAnalyzing the archive, we found that the contents were last modified on Feb. 14, 2025. Further, the archive itself contains\nan executable file\ncontaining an identical name as the ZIP and a zero-byte file named\npic1.png\n.\nReviewing the executable metadata, we found that the file version is presented as\n2025,2,13,0\n, suggesting that the file was likely created one day prior, on Feb. 13. This date also corresponds to the PE compile timestamp.\nAdditionally, the metadata shows that the file\u2019s original name was\nDiaoYu.exe\n. The term Diaoyu translates to fishing, or phishing in a cybersecurity context.\nThe malware employs a dual-stage execution guardrail to thwart automated sandbox analysis. Beyond the hardware requirement of a horizontal screen resolution greater than or equal to 1440, the sample performs an environmental dependency check for a specific file (\npic1.png\n) in its execution directory.\nIn this context,\npic1.png\nacts as a file-based integrity check. If the malware sample is submitted to a sandbox in isolation, the absence of this auxiliary file causes the process to terminate gracefully before detonation, effectively masking its malicious behavior. Only upon satisfying these prerequisites does the malware proceed to audit the host for the following cybersecurity products:\nAvp.exe\n(Kaspersky)\nSentryEye.exe\n(Avira)\nEPSecurityService.exe\n(Bitdefender)\nSentinelUI.exe\n(Sentinel One)\nNortonSecurity.exe\n(Symantec)\nThis narrow selection of products is interesting, and it is unclear why the actor chose to only look for these specific products. While various malware families commonly check for the presence of antivirus products, malware authors typically include a more comprehensive list that encompasses a variety of global providers.\nAfter checking for these products, the malware downloads the following files from GitHub:\nhxxps[:]//raw.githubusercontent[.]com/padeqav/WordPress/refs/heads/master/wp-includes/images/admin-bar-sprite[.]png\nhxxps[:]//raw.githubusercontent[.]com/padeqav/WordPress/refs/heads/master/wp-includes/images/Linux[.]jpg\nhxxps[:]//raw.githubusercontent[.]com/padeqav/WordPress/refs/heads/master/wp-includes/images/Windows[.]jpg\nIt should be noted that the padeqav GitHub project is no longer available.\nFinally, the malware performs a series of actions on these files that ultimately result in the installation of a Cobalt Strike payload.\nExploitation\nIn addition to phishing campaigns, the group often couples exploitation attempts with their reconnaissance activities to gain initial access to target networks. To date, we have not observed the group developing, testing or deploying any zero-day exploits. However, we assess that the group is comfortable testing and deploying a wide range of common tools, exploitation kits and proof-of-concept code for N-day exploits.\nFor example, over the past year, our Advanced Threat Prevention service has detected and blocked attempts by the group to exploit the following types of vulnerabilities:\nSAP Solution Manager privilege escalation vulnerability\nPivotal Spring Data Commons remote file read XXE vulnerability\nMicrosoft Open Management Infrastructure remote code execution vulnerability\nMicrosoft Exchange Server remote code execution vulnerability\nD-Link remote code execution vulnerability\nHTTP directory traversal request attempt\nHTTP SQL injection attempt\nStruts2 OGNL remote code execution vulnerability\nRuijieyi Networks remote command execution vulnerability\nEyou Email System remote command execution vulnerability\nBeijing Grandview Century eHR Software SQL injection vulnerability\nWeaver Ecology-OA remote code execution vulnerability\nMicrosoft Windows\nwin.ini\naccess attempt detected\nCommvault CommCell CVSearchService download file authentication bypass vulnerability\nZhiyuan OA remote code execution vulnerability\nOn one occasion, we observed the actor connecting to e-passport and e-visa services associated with a ministry of foreign affairs. Because the server for these services was configured with Atlassian Crowd software, the actor attempted to exploit\nCVE-2019-11580\n, uploading a payload named\nrce.jar\n. The code included in the payload was similar to the description of code from another analysis of CVE-2019-11580 provided by\nAnquanke\n.\nTooling\nWe assess that the group relies heavily on a mix of command-and\u2013control (C2) frameworks and tools common to the actors\u2019 region to move laterally and maintain persistent access within compromised environments.\nC2 Frameworks\nFrom 2024 through early 2025, we observed the group commonly deploying Cobalt Strike payloads. However, over time the group slowly transitioned to VShell as its tool of choice.\nVShell is a Go-based C2 framework. The group often configures its web access on 5-digit ephemeral TCP ports using ordered numbers. In November 2025,\nNVISO published comprehensive research [PDF]\non the origins of this tool, its features and its wide-scale use by multiple threat groups and actors.\nWithin the past year, we assess that the group has also leveraged frameworks like Havoc, SparkRat and Sliver with varying degrees of success.\nWeb Shells\nTGR-STA-1030 has frequently deployed web shells on external-facing web servers as well as on internal web servers to maintain access and enable lateral movement. The three most common web shells used by the group are Behinder, Neo-reGeorg and Godzilla.\nFurther, we noted during one investigation that the group attempted to obfuscate its Godzilla web shells using code from the\nTas9er\nGitHub project. This project obfuscates code by creating functions and strings with names like\nBaidu\n. It also adds explicit messages to governments.\nTunnels\nWe have observed the group leveraging GO Simple Tunnel (GOST), Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS), and IOX across both their C2 infrastructure and compromised networks to tunnel desired network traffic.\nIntroducing ShadowGuard\nDuring an investigation, we identified the group using a new Linux kernel rootkit, ShadowGuard. The sample we discovered (SHA-256 hash\n7808B1E01EA790548B472026AC783C73A033BB90BBE548BF3006ABFBCB48C52D\n) is an Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) rootkit designed for Linux systems. At this time, we assess that the use of this rootkit is unique to this group.\neBPF backdoors are notoriously difficult to detect because they operate entirely within the highly trusted kernel space. eBPF programs do not appear as separate modules. Instead, they execute inside the kernel's BPF virtual machine, making them inherently stealthy. This allows them to manipulate core system functions and audit logs before security tools or system monitoring applications can see the true data.\nThis backdoor leverages eBPF technology to provide the following kernel-level stealth capabilities:\nKernel-level concealment:\nIt can conceal process information details directly at the kernel level.\nProcess hiding (syscall interception):\nThe tool intercepts critical system calls, specifically using custom kill signals (entry and exit points) to identify which processes the attacker wants to hide.\nIt conceals specified process IDs (PIDs), making them invisible to standard user-space analysis tools like the standard Linux\nps aux\ncommand\nIt can hide up to 32 processes simultaneously\nFile and directory hiding:\nIt features a hard-coded check to specifically conceal directories and files named\nswsecret\n.\nAllow-listing:\nThe backdoor includes an allow list mechanism where processes placed on the list are deliberately excluded and remain unaffected by the hiding functionality.\nWhen started, the program will automatically check for the following:\nRoot privileges\neBPF support\nTracepoint support\nExample commands once ShadowGuard is started are shown below in Table 1.\nCommand\nOverview\nkill -900 1234\n-900\n= Add target PID (1234) to the allow list\nkill -901 1234\n-901\n= Remove target PID (1234) from the allow list\ntouch swsecret_config.txt\nmkdir swsecret_data\n* Note: By default ShadowGuard hides/conceals any directories or files named\nswsecret\n. This could be a shortened, internal code name used by the rootkit's developers to tag their own files. Example: \u201cPut all configuration and logs inside a directory named\nswsecret\n.\u201d\nls -la\nfiles/directories beginning with\nswsecret\nshould display as a dot\n.\n(i.e., it should be hidden)\nTable 1. Examples of commands for ShadowGuard.\nInfrastructure\nConsistent with any advanced actor conducting cyberespionage, this group goes to great lengths to mask and obfuscate the origin of its operations. However, despite all of its best efforts, it is exceptionally hard to overcome the following two challenges:\nNetwork Traffic Inspection: It is widely known that several nations employ methods to censor and filter traffic entering/exiting their respective countries. As such, it is extremely unlikely that foreign cyberespionage groups would willingly route their network traffic through any nation that employs these inspection capabilities.\nNetwork evolution: Maintaining infrastructure for cyberespionage operations is hard. It requires the routine creation of new domains, virtual private servers (VPS) and network tunnels. Studying a group\u2019s infrastructure over time almost always reveals mistakes and errors where tunnels collapse or perhaps identity protection services expire.\nNetwork Structure\nWe assess that the group applies a multi-tiered infrastructure approach to obfuscate its activities.\nVictim-Facing\nThe group routinely leases and configures its C2 servers on infrastructure owned by a variety of legitimate and commonly known VPS providers. However, unlike most groups that configure their malicious infrastructure on bulletproof providers or in obscure locations, this group prefers to establish its infrastructure in countries that have a strong rule of law.\nFor example, the group frequently chooses virtual servers in the U.S., UK and Singapore. We assess this preference in locations likely aids the group in three ways:\nInfrastructure may appear more legitimate to network defenders\nThis could enable low-latency connections across the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia\nThese locations have separate laws, policies and priorities that govern the operations of their domestic law enforcement and foreign intelligence organizations. Thus, having infrastructure in these locations likely necessitates cross-agency cooperation efforts for their governments to effectively investigate and track the group.\nRelays\nTo connect to the C2 infrastructure, the group leases additional VPS infrastructure that it uses to relay traffic through. These hosts are often configured with SSH on port 22 or a high-numbered ephemeral port. In some cases, we have also observed hosts configured with RDP on port 3389.\nProxies\nOver time, the group has leveraged a variety of capabilities to anonymize its connections to the relay infrastructure. In early 2025, we observed the group using infrastructure we associated with DataImpulse, a company that provides residential proxy services. Since then, we have observed the group using the Tor network and other proxy services.\nUpstream\nIn tracking upstream infrastructure, it is important to recognize that the primary goal of an espionage group is to steal data. To accomplish that task, a group has to build a path from the compromised network back to a network it can access. As such, the flow of data upstream typically correlates geographically to the group\u2019s physical location.\nAs noted above, the act of maintaining all of this infrastructure and its associated connections is quite challenging. On occasion, the group makes mistakes either because it forgets to establish a tunnel or because a tunnel collapses. When this happens, the group connects directly from its upstream infrastructure.\nOn several occasions, we have observed the group connecting directly to relay and victim-facing infrastructure from IP addresses belonging to Autonomous System (AS) 9808. These IP addresses are owned by an internet service provider in the group\u2019s region.\nDomains\nWe have identified several domains used by the group to facilitate malware C2 communications. Most were registered with the following top-level domains:\nme\nlive\nhelp\ntech\nNoteworthy domains include:\ngouvn[.]me\nThe group used this domain to target Francophone countries that use\ngouv\nto denote government domains. While the actor consistently pointed this domain name to leased victim-facing VPS infrastructure, we noted an anomaly in late 2024. While the domain never pointed to it, the actor appears to have copied an X.509 certificate with the common name\ngouvn[.]me\nfrom a victim-facing VPS to a Tencent server located in the actors\u2019 region. Here it was visible for four days in November 2024.\ndog3rj[.]tech\nThe group used this domain to target European nations. It\u2019s possible that the domain name could be a reference to \u201cDOGE Jr,\u201d which has several meanings in a Western context, such as the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency or the name of a cryptocurrency. This domain was registered using an email address associated with the domain\n888910[.]xyz\n.\nzamstats[.]me\nThe group used this domain to target the Zambian government.\nGlobal Targeting Overview\nOver the course of the past year the group has substantially increased its scanning and reconnaissance efforts. This shift follows the group's evolution from phishing emails to exploits for initial access. Most emblematic of this activity, we observed the group scanning infrastructure across 155 countries between November and December 2025, as noted in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Countries targeted by TGR-STA-1030 reconnaissance between November and December 2025.\nGiven the expansive nature of the activity, some analysts might wrongly assume that the group simply launches broad scans across the entire IPv4 space from\n1.1.1[.]1\nto\n255.255.255[.]255\n, but that is not the case. Based on our observation, the group focuses its scanning narrowly on government infrastructure and specific targets of interest across each country.\nThe group\u2019s reconnaissance efforts shed light on its global interests. We have also observed the group's success at compromising several government and critical infrastructure organizations globally. We assess that over the past year, the group compromised at least 70 organizations across 37 countries, as shown in Figure 3. The attackers were able to maintain access to several of the impacted entities for months.\nFigure 3. Locations of organizations impacted in 2025.\nImpacted organizations include ministries and departments of interior, foreign affairs, finance, trade, economy, immigration, mining, justice and energy.\nThis group compromised one nation\u2019s parliament and a senior elected official of another. It also compromised national-level telecommunications companies and several national police and counter-terrorism organizations.\nWhile this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services.\nBy closely monitoring the timing of the group\u2019s operations, we have drawn correlations between several of its campaigns and real-world events. These correlations inform assessments as to the group\u2019s potential motivations. The following sections provide additional insights from notable situations by geographic region.\nAmericas\nDuring the U.S. government shutdown that began in October 2025, the group began to display greater interest in organizations and events occurring across North, Central and South American countries. Over that month, we observed scanning of government infrastructure across Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago.\nPerhaps the most pronounced reconnaissance occurred on Oct. 31, 2025, when we observed connections to at least 200 IP addresses hosting Government of Honduras infrastructure. The timing of this activity falls just 30 days prior to the national election, in which both candidates signaled openness to restoring diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\nIn addition to reconnaissance activities, we assess that the group likely compromised government entities across Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela, as noted in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. Location of impacted entities in the Americas.\nBolivia\nWe assess that the group likely compromised the network of a Bolivian entity associated with mining. The motivation behind this activity could be associated with interest in rare earth minerals.\nWe find it noteworthy that the topic of mining rights became a central focus in Bolivia\u2019s recent presidential election. In late July 2025, candidate Jorge Quiroga pledged to scrap multi-billion-dollar mining deals that the Bolivian government had previously signed with two nations.\nBrazil\nWe assess that the group compromised Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Mines and Energy. Brazil is considered to have the second largest supply of rare earth mineral reserves in the world.\nAccording to public reporting, exports of these minerals tripled in the first half of 2025. As Asian companies tighten their global control on these resources, the U.S. has begun looking to Brazil for alternative sourcing.\nIn October, the U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Brazil held meetings with mining executives in the country. In early November, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation invested $465 million in Serra Verde (a Brazilian rare earth producer). This has been seen as an effort to reduce reliance on Asia for these key minerals.\nMexico\nWe assess that the group compromised two of Mexico\u2019s ministries. This activity is very likely associated with international trade agreements.\nOn Sept. 25, 2025, Mexico News Daily reported on an investigation into Mexico\u2019s latest plans to impose tariffs on certain goods. Coincidentally, malicious network traffic was first seen originating from networks belonging to Mexico\u2019s ministries within 24 hours of the trade probe announcement.\nPanama\nIn December 2025, a report stated that local authorities destroyed a monument, prompting immediate condemnation from some leaders and calls for investigation.\nCoincidentally, around the same time, we assess that TGR-STA-1030 likely compromised government infrastructure that may be associated with the investigation.\nVenezuela\nOn Jan. 3, 2026, the U.S. launched Operation Absolute Resolve. This operation resulted in the capture of the Venezuelan president and his wife. In the days that followed, TGR-STA-1030 conducted extensive reconnaissance activities targeting at least 140 government-owned IP addresses.\nWe further assess that as early as Jan. 4, 2026, the group likely compromised an IP address that geolocates to a Venezolana de Industria Tecnol\u00f3gica facility, as seen in Figure 5. This organization was originally founded as a joint venture between the Venezuelan government and an Asian technology company. The venture enabled the production of computers as an early step toward deepening technology and economic ties between the two regions.\nFigure 5. Geolocation data for the compromised IP address.\nEurope\nThroughout 2025, TGR-STA-1030 increased its focus on European nations. In July 2025, it applied a concerted focus toward Germany, where it initiated connections to over 490 IP addresses hosting government infrastructure.\nIn August 2025, Czech President Petr Pavel privately met with the Dalai Lama during a trip to India. In the weeks that followed, we observed scanning of Czech government infrastructure, including:\nThe Army\nPolice\nParliament\nMinistries of Interior, Finance and Foreign Affairs\nIn early November, a Tibetan news source announced that the\nCzech president would also co-patronize the Dalai Lama\u2019s 90th birthday gala\n. Shortly after, we witnessed a second round of scanning focused narrowly on the Czech president\u2019s website.\nSeparately, in late August, the group applied a concerted focus on European Union infrastructure. We observed the group attempting to connect to over 600 IP addresses hosting\n*.europa[.]eu\ndomains.\nIn addition to reconnaissance activities, we assess that the group likely compromised government entities in countries across Cyprus, Czechia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Serbia, as shown in Figure 6. In doing so, the group compromised at least one ministry of finance where it sought to collect intelligence on international development from both the impacted country as well as the European Union.\nFigure 6. Location of impacted entities in Europe.\nCyprus\nWe assess that the group compromised government infrastructure in early 2025. The timing of this activity coincided with efforts by an Asian nation to expand certain economic partnerships across Europe. At the time, Cyprus was also taking preparatory steps toward assuming the presidency of the Council of the European Union at the end of the year, a position that it currently holds.\nGreece\nWe assess that the group likely compromised infrastructure associated with the\nSyzefxis Project\n. This project was intended to modernize Greek public sector organizations using high-speed internet services.\nAsia and Oceania\nWhile the group performs scanning widely across both continents, TGR-STA-1030 appears to prioritize its reconnaissance efforts against countries in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand regions. We routinely observe scanning of government infrastructure across Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. For example, in early November 2025, we observed connections to 31 IP addresses hosting Thai government infrastructure.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the group's reconnaissance efforts often extend beyond connections to web-facing content on ports 80 and 443. In November 2025, we also observed the group attempting to initiate connections to port 22 (SSH) on infrastructure belonging to:\nAustralia\u2019s Treasury Department\nAfghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Finance\nNepal\u2019s Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers\nIn addition to reconnaissance activities, we assess that the group likely compromised government and critical infrastructure entities in countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Location of impacted entities in Asia and Oceania.\nIndonesia\nIn March 2024, Indonesia pledged to increase certain counterterrorism coordination efforts. In mid-2025, the group compromised an Indonesian law enforcement entity.\nWe assess that the group also compromised infrastructure associated with an Indonesian government official. This activity might have been associated with the extraction of natural resources from Papua province. We found that the official was tasked with overseeing development in the province and foreign investment in the mining sector.\nThe group also compromised an Indonesian airline. The compromised infrastructure geolocates to facilities at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport as shown in Figure 8. The airline had been in talks with a U.S. aerospace manufacturer to purchase new aircraft as part of its strategic growth plans. At the same time, a competing interest was actively promoting aircraft from a manufacturer based in Southeast Asia.\nFigure 8. Geolocation data for the compromised IP address.\nMalaysia\nWe assess that the group compromised multiple Malaysian government departments and ministries. Using this access, the group sought to extract immigration and economic intelligence data.\nAdditionally, we assess that the group compromised a large private financial entity in Malaysia that provides microloans in support of low-income households and small businesses.\nMongolia\nThe group compromised a Mongolian law enforcement entity on Sept. 15, 2025. Shortly after, Mongolia\u2019s Minister of Justice and Internal Affairs met with a counterpart from an Asian nation. Following the meeting, both countries signaled an intent to expand cooperation to combat transnational crime.\nGiven the timing, we assess that this activity was likely associated with intelligence gathering in support of the initial meeting and ongoing cooperation discussions.\nTaiwan\nIn early 2025, the group compromised a major supplier in Taiwan's power equipment industry. With this access, we believe the group was able to access business files and directories pertaining to power generation projects across Taiwan. We further assess that in mid-December 2025, the group regained access to this network.\nThailand\nWe assess that on Nov. 5, 2025, the group compromised a Thai government department where it likely sought economic and international trade intelligence. The timing of this activity overlaps with the government\u2019s effort to expand diplomatic relations with neighboring nations. As such, we assess the activity was likely intelligence gathering in support of the visit and future cooperation discussions.\nAfrica\nIt is our observation that when it comes to African nations, the group's focus remains split between military interests and the advancement of economic interests, specifically mining efforts.\nWe assess that the group likely compromised government and critical infrastructure entities in countries across the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria and Zambia, as shown in Figure 9:\nFigure 9. Location of impacted entities in Africa.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)\nWe assess that in December 2025, the group compromised a government ministry in this country. We found that earlier in the year, an Asian mining firm was responsible for an acid spill that caused significant impacts to a river in neighboring Zambia. In November 2025, a second spill by another Asian company impacted the waterways around Lubumbashi, the second-largest city in the DRC. This event prompted authorities to suspend mining operations for a subsidiary of the Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. Given the timing and the group's unique focus on mining operations, we assess that activity could be related to this mining situation.\nDjibouti\nSeveral nations maintain military bases in Djibouti. These bases enable combating piracy on the high seas as well as other regional logistics and defense functions across the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.\nIn mid-November, a new Naval Escort Group from one of the nations assumed responsibilities in the region. During its operational debut, the group escorted a Panamanian-registered bulk carrier called the Nasco Gem that carries cargo such as coal and ore. In the context of cyber activity, this could be related to the targeting of mining sectors we observed from TGR-STA-1030.\nWe assess that in late October 2025, the group gained access to a Djibouti government network. Given the timing of the activity, we believe it might be associated with intelligence collection in support of the naval handover operations.\nZambia\nWe assess that the group compromised a Zambian government network in 2025. This activity is likely associated with the Sino-Metals Leach Zambia situation.\nIn February, a dam that held waste from an Asian mining operation collapsed and polluted a major river with cyanide and arsenic. The situation and associated clean-up efforts remain a political point of contention.\nConclusion\nTGR-STA-1030 remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide. The group primarily targets government ministries and departments for espionage purposes. We assess that it prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.\nOver the past year, this group has compromised government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries. Given the scale of compromise and the significance of the impacted government entities, we are working with industry peers and government partners to raise awareness of the threat and disrupt this activity.\nWe encourage network defenders and security researchers to leverage the indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided below to investigate and deploy defenses against this group.\nPalo Alto Networks Protection and Mitigation\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products and services:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nand\nAdvanced DNS Security\nidentify known URLs and domains associated with this activity as malicious.\nThe\nAdvanced WildFire\nmachine-learning models and analysis techniques have been reviewed and updated in light of the indicators shared in this research.\nAdvanced Threat Prevention\nis designed to defend networks against both commodity threats and targeted threats.\nCortex XDR\nand\nXSIAM\nhelp to protect against the threats described in this blog, by employing the\nMalware Prevention Engine\n.

Discover Unit 42\u2019s latest insights on defeating social engineering and securing your digital life. The post Why Smart People Fall For Phishing Attacks appeared first on Unit 42 .\n\nThreat Research Center\nInsights\nOpinions\nOpinions\nWhy Smart People Fall For Phishing Attacks\n4\nmin read\nRelated Products\nUnit 42 Incident Response\nBy:\nRia Bhatia\nPublished:\nFebruary 3, 2026\nCategories:\nBusiness Email Compromise\nCybercrime\nInsights\nOpinions\nTags:\nAI\nPhishing\nShare\nThe cybersecurity landscape of 2026 is stronger than ever with countless security resources and protective tools. Despite robust defenses at anyone\u2019s fingertips, common phishing scams and spoofing attacks remain an ongoing issue. Unfortunately, the reality is that these attacks aren\u2019t disappearing; they\u2019re simply evolving.\nWhile we cannot surely predict the future statistics of these types of attacks, data from the past five years showcases similar trends, despite advances in security technologies. In 2025, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\nCISA\n) reported that phishing emails are associated with more than 90% of successful cyberattacks. Even though overall numbers of phishing attacks have slightly decreased, their effectiveness in terms of monetary assets stolen has\nincreased [PDF]\n. But why is this the case? Why are these tactics still effective even with elevated defenses?\nThe Psychology of Phishing\nPhishing is a multifaceted cybercrime that has evolved extensively. Attackers are constantly advancing their techniques with any means available, resulting in more targeted and stealthier intrusions. There is no solid indicator on what ensures that a phishing attack will be successful. However, a variety of tactics all revolve around the same common avenue:\nthe human element.\nIn her\nThreat Vector\nfeature, Palo Alto Networks Consultant Sama Manchanda details how attackers use psychological theories to ensure maximum effectiveness when targeting their potential victims. There are three main stages:\nThe Bait:\nAttackers first research victims to discover exactly what will attract them\nThe Hook:\nThey deliver attractive information designed to grab the victim\u2019s attention\nThe Catch:\nOnce the victim engages by performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or entering credentials), the compromise is initiated\nThese stages provide the blueprint of how attackers exploit human emotions in order to bypass defenses. The most effective attacks also employ\nsocial engineering tactics\n. Unit 42 has observed three prevalent techniques:\nUrgency and Fear:\nAttackers combine scare tactics such as identity theft, legal action or account suspension with extreme urgency to panic victims into clicking malicious links or revealing sensitive data without fully considering the consequences.\nAuthority and Trust:\nAttackers impersonate legitimate figures, such as company executives, IT staff or university administrators to trick the victim into trusting them. These tactics are often assisted by the use of AI deepfakes.\nDistraction:\nAttackers take advantage of individuals\u2019 desensitized attitudes towards routine actions such as clicking a link or scanning a QR code. When individuals are in a rush or in between tasks, attackers use these fleeting moments to strike.\nThese tactics demonstrate how attackers have mastered the psychological triggers required to manipulate users into surrendering assets. They also serve as a stark reminder that technology alone cannot prevent these attacks. True security requires a shift in personal mindset and proactive commitment to digital vigilance.\nHow Cognitive Bias Opens the Door\nOutside of an attacker\u2019s toolkit, certain inherent human traits can actually increase a person\u2019s vulnerability. In her\nThreat Vector\nfeature, Lisa Plaggemier, Executive Director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, discusses how overconfidence and the \u201cillusion of control\u201d create dangerous blind spots.\nAfter surveying individuals across the globe, Plaggemier discovered an alarming trend: a vast majority of individuals rated their phishing detection skills as nearly perfect. This universal tendency to overestimate one's expertise is exactly what attackers take advantage of. When confidence exceeds actual competence, the risk of a breach increases exponentially.\nPlaggemier\u2019s studies highlight how individuals prioritize their own intuition instead of trusting in proven security protocols. By overvaluing personal habits, users internally diminish the worth of reliable technical controls. This confidence poses a significant risk because it can override a person\u2019s intellectual knowledge by prompting them to ignore logic in favor of self-validation. It furthers the \"contrarian mindset\u201d where humans tend to reject educational messages that contradict their belief in their own abilities. Instead of learning or adapting to real-time situations, they adopt a defensive stance. This reaction creates a dangerous cycle that reinforces bad habits and leaves room for compromises.\nThe Future of Phishing\nThe advancement of AI has permanently altered the phishing landscape by erasing the misspelled words and awkward phrasing that once gave attackers away. This combined with the addition of deepfakes and voice mimicry has made it nearly impossible to distinguish a friend from a fraud through traditional means. As a result, these advancements raise the critical question on how individuals can truly stay protected.\nThe hard truth is that no one is ever 100% secure. The most persistent attackers will constantly find ways to innovate and adjust. Factors such as cognitive bias and the \u201cillusion of control\u201d tell us that we can accurately identify phishing attempts, but it\u2019s clear that going strictly off intuition is a flawed approach. To survive the AI shift, we must stop relying on instinct and start relying on consistent efforts such as:\nMaintain a zero-trust mindset:\nAssume every unsolicited request requires verification\nStay educated:\nKeep up with the latest phishing trends and AI-driven tactics\nRecognize psychological triggers:\nBe wary of messages designed to create fear or extreme urgency\nPractice\ncyber hygiene\n:\nRefrain from clicking unknown links and keep credentials secure\nUnit 42\u2019s Biggest Piece of Advice: Pause and Identify the Facts\nNo matter how convincing a message appears or how urgent a request feels, stop and truly assess the situation. Taking a moment to verify the source before taking any sort of action can stop an attack in its tracks.\nSecurity is a continuous journey rather than a final destination. By choosing to analyze the information given rather than succumbing to an attacker\u2019s strategies, you transform yourself from a potential victim into an active defender of your digital life.\nAdditional Resources\nEvolution of Sophisticated Phishing Tactics: The QR Code Phenomenon\n\u2013 Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks\nMyth Busting: Why \"Innocent Clicks\" Don't Exist in Cybersecurity\n\u2013 Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks\nThreat Vector\n\u2013 Palo Alto Networks\nStay Secure: Why Cyber Hygiene Should Be Part of Your Personal Hygiene\n\u2013 Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks\nAI-Powered Polymorphic Phishing Is Changing the Threat Landscape\n\u2013 SecurityWeek\n2024 IC3 ANNUAL REPORT [PDF]\n\u2013 Federal Bureau of Investigation\nShield's Up: Guidance for Families\n\u2013 CISA\nBack to top\nTags\nAI\nPhishing\nThreat Research Center\nNext: Privileged File System Vulnerability Present in a SCADA System\nTable of Contents\nRelated Articles\nPhishing on the Edge of the Web and Mobile Using QR Codes\nThe Shadow Campaigns: Uncovering Global Espionage\nUnderstanding the Russian Cyberthreat to the 2026 Winter Olympics\nRelated  Resources\nThreat Actor Groups\nFebruary 10, 2026\nA Peek Into Muddled Libra\u2019s Operational Playbook\nMuddled Libra\nPowerShell\nScattered Spider\nRead now\nInsights\nJanuary 29, 2026\nUnderstanding the Russian Cyberthreat to the 2026 Winter Olympics\nAI\nIoT\nRussia\nRead now\nInsights\nDecember 23, 2025\nWho Does Cybersecurity Need?

Iconics Suite is the name of a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. This system is used for controlling and monitoring industrial processes in different industries including automotive, energy and manufacturing.\nIn early 2024 we conducted an assessment of Iconics Suite and identified five vulnerabilities. These were for Microsoft Windows versions 10.97.2 and earlier.\nWe published on related vulnerabilities\nin a previous post. This article concentrates on the analysis of CVE-2025-0921.\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system. Additional details are outlined in Table 1.\nCVE Identifier\nVulnerability Description\nScore\nCVE-2025-0921\nExecution with unnecessary privileges vulnerability in multiple services of Mitsubishi Electric Iconics Digital Solutions GENESIS64.\n6.5 - Medium\nTable 1. Details on CVE-2025-0921.\nAttackers could misuse privileged file system operations in a machine running a vulnerable version of Iconics Suite to elevate privileges to corrupt critical binaries, compromising the integrity and availability of the system. We coordinated with the Iconics security team, which released an\nadvisory detailing measures to address the issue\n. If applied, the workaround removes all our reported vulnerabilities.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this post with the following products and services:\nOT Device Security\nis the Palo Alto Networks operational technology (OT) solution with security services that work within our\nNext-Generation Firewall\n(NGFW).\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\n.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nVulnerabilities\n,\nPrivilege Escalation\n,\nCVE-2025-0921\nBackground\nIn a\nprior article\n, we reported on five vulnerabilities that we had discovered within Iconics Suite in versions 10.97.3 and earlier. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to escalate privileges and ultimately render vulnerable systems inoperable. Related to this investigation, we found one further issue, which we've now documented in this article.\nUnderstanding the Vulnerability Context\nProcesses running with elevated privileges represent a significant security risk, particularly when they interact with sensitive files and directories without proper access controls. This is known as a privileged file system operations vulnerability.\nThis type of vulnerability can create opportunities for attackers to exploit file system operations such as creating, overwriting, copying, moving or deleting files. These actions can have various security consequences, ranging from DoS and information leakage to complete system compromise.\nThe\nCVE-2025-0921\nvulnerability allows privileged file system operations in Iconics Suite that attackers can misuse to corrupt critical system binaries and disrupt the availability and integrity of the SCADA system. This vulnerability can be exploited in various scenarios. Our demonstration leverages a previously identified vulnerability\nCVE-2024-7587\nthat creates an optimal attack environment by granting excessive file permissions.\nTo demonstrate the full impact of CVE-2025-0921, we use a vulnerability chain that includes CVE-2024-7587 (detailed in\nprevious research\n). CVE-2024-7587 affects the\nGenBroker32\ninstaller, which grants excessive permissions to the\nC:\\ProgramData\\ICONICS\ndirectory, allowing any user on the system to modify critical configuration files.\nIn Iconics Suite, we found this privileged file system operation vulnerability in the\nPager Agent\n, a component of the\nAlarmWorX64 MMX\nfeature set. AlarmWorX64 MMX is the alarm management system that monitors industrial processes and automatically triggers alerts when problems occur.\nThe Pager Agent enables administrators to establish customized triggers and activity alerts in AlarmWorX64 MMX. These alerts are managed through\nPagerCfg.exe\n, the configuration utility for the Pager Agent. This utility allows administrators to configure the alerts for delivery via a wide variety of pager services and protocols such as SMS, GSM and TAP.\nFigure 1 shows the Pager Agent configuration window displayed when running\nPagerCfg.exe\non a Windows host.\nFigure 1. Pager Agent configuration window when running\nPagerCfg.exe\n.\nTo configure SMS alerts, administrators can use the SMS Unicode button shown in Figure 1 to open the\nSMS configuration\nwindow. Figure 2 shows the parameters in the SMS Unicode Configuration window.\nFigure 2. SMS Unicode Configuration window.\nThis SMS Unicode Configuration window enables system administrators to select a device, baud rate and recipients, and to compose the alert message body. This configuration window also provides the option to send a test SMS.\nIn addition to SMS configuration, the\nPagerCfg.exe\nenables administrators to define a path for an\nSMSLogFile\n, as shown in Figure 2, where logging information will be written. Once an administrator defines the\nSMSLogFil\ne path, the application will write every log for each SMS operation into this file.\nThe Critical Configuration File Vulnerability\nAfter an administrator configures the Pager Agent using\nPagerCfg.exe\n, the path for the\nSMSLogFile\nis saved in the\nC:\\ProgramData\\ICONICS\\IcoSetup64.ini\nconfiguration file. In a normal security environment, this configuration file would be protected from modification by unprivileged users. However, when GenBroker32 is installed on the system, CVE-2024-7587 comes into play.\nGenBroker32\nis a legacy communications utility included in the Iconics software suite \u200b\u200bthat helps older industrial systems connect to newer Iconics software by translating between different communication protocols. The vulnerability in GenBroker32's installer (CVE-2024-7587) grants full read and write access to the\nC:\\ProgramData\\ICONICS\ndirectory for every user on the system, making the\nIcoSetup64.ini\nconfiguration file writable by any local user.\nFigure 3 shows the permissions of\nGraphWorX64\n, a central HMI/SCADA visualization component of the Iconics Suite, for\nC:\\ProgramData\\ICONICS\nthat the GenBroker32 installer had modified.\nFigure 3. Permissions of GraphWorX64.\nExploiting the Vulnerability\nIn a scenario where an attacker gains non-administrative access to a system with GenBroker32 installed, the attacker could manipulate any information contained within the configuration file. This is especially true of the\nSMSLogFile\npath that controls where the application logs SMS activity.\nOn a system with GenBroker32 installed, an attacker could perform the following steps to exploit CVE-2025-0921 (leveraging the excessive permissions from CVE-2024-7587) to perform a DoS attack.\nStep 1\nLogged in as a non-administrative user, an attacker can discover the\nSMSLogFile\npath by inspecting the\nIcoSetup64.ini\nfile located in\nC:\\ProgramData\\ICONICS\n. The path for the\nSMSLogFile\nis\nC:\\users\\iconics_user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\logs\\log.tx\nt as shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4.\nSMSLogFile\npath highlighted in the\nIcoSetup64.ini\nconfiguration file.\nStep 2\nThe attacker creates a specially\ncrafted symbolic link\n(called symlinks) from the\nSMSLogFile\nlocation to the target binary. The attacker does not require administrator privileges to create this symbolic link. In our security assessment, we selected\ncng.sys\nas the target binary. Subsequently,\nPagerCfg.exe\nwrites or overwrites the contents of this binary, and as a consequence corrupts the target binary.\nThe\ncng.sys\ndriver is used for\nMicrosoft Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG)\n. CNG provides cryptographic services in Windows system components. The\ncng.sys\ndriver usually resides in the\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\ndirectory. However, if\ncng.sys\nis present in its parent directory\nC:\\Windows\\System32\n, Windows might attempt to load the driver file from\nC:\\Windows\\System32\ninstead of\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\n.\nIf an attacker successfully creates an invalid driver or corrupts a valid driver at\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cng.sys\n, the operating system would fail to boot. This can be achieved by combining Object Manager symbolic links with NTFS mount points to create file symbolic links without administrator privileges.\nStep 3\nThe attacker would then wait for an administrator to send a test message through the SMS Unicode Configuration window or for AlarmWorx MMX to automatically trigger an alert.\nFigure 5 shows an example of the SMS Unicode Configuration parameters we used during our security assessment, including the\nSMSLogFile\npath.\nFigure 5. SMS Unicode Configuration window.\nWhen an SMS is sent, this configuration directs its logging information to follow the symbolic link from\nC:\\ProgramData\\ICONICS\\LogFiles\\log.txt\nto\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cng.sys\n, effectively redirecting the logging data into\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cng.sys.\nThe altered content of\ncng.sys\nwould now contain the SMS information log data instead of the expected binary. We verified this by inspecting\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cng.sys\nusing\nCFF Explorer\nas shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Hex dump of the newly altered\ncng.sys\nfile created by the exploit.\nStep 4\nUpon rebooting the machine, the operating system would then attempt to load\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cng.sys\n. However, since the newly altered file is not a valid driver but a log file, the loading process would fail. This failure would cause the operating system to become stuck in failed repair mode, as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Endless Windows boot loop caused by the corrupted driver.\nTo summarize this DoS attack method:\nWhile logged in as a local user without administrator privileges, the attacker would first identify the\nSMSLogFile\npath previously set by the administrator in the\nIcoSetup64.ini\nfile.\nThen, by creating a symbolic link, the attacker would corrupt a critical binary such as the\ncng.sys\ndriver.\nThe attacker would then wait for the administrator to trigger an SMS, redirecting logging information to the\ncng.sys\nfile, which would result in a corrupted version of the\ncng.sys\ndriver.\nUpon reboot, the operating system would unsuccessfully attempt to load the corrupted driver. This would result in a failed boot, leaving the machine in repair mode, causing a DoS in a critical OT engineering workstation.\nEven if the vulnerability CVE-2024-7587 described in our previous\nthreat research article\nwere not present, attackers could still exploit CVE-2025-0921 if the log file became writable by unprivileged users through other means. For example, this could include misconfigurations, alternative vulnerabilities or social engineering attacks that modify file permissions.\nConclusion\nPeople often overlook the possibility of attackers misusing privileged file system operations, regardless of the danger they can pose to systems running these processes. This is especially pertinent when these vulnerabilities are found in OT environments.\nThe discovery of vulnerabilities within the Iconics Suite for Microsoft Windows versions 10.97.2 and earlier highlights the importance of robust security measures.

We discuss the potential threat picture. The post Understanding the Russian Cyberthreat to the 2026 Winter Olympics appeared first on Unit 42 .\n\nThreat Research Center\nInsights\nOpinions\nOpinions\nUnderstanding the Russian Cyberthreat to the 2026 Winter Olympics\n5\nmin read\nBy:\nJustin Moore\nPublished:\nJanuary 29, 2026\nCategories:\nCybercrime\nInsights\nOpinions\nTags:\nAI\nIoT\nRussia\nShare\nThe 2026 Winter Games in Milano Cortina extend beyond sport. Tensions between the Russian Federation and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), stemming from disputes over compliance and governance, lie within a broader geopolitical context. In this environment, the Games may face increased cyber risk, as major international events increasingly intersect with geopolitical competition. The exclusion of Russia from a global stage of historic national importance removes a critical geopolitical guardrail protecting the 2026 Winter Olympic Games.\nFrom Olympic Sanctions to Political Exclusion\nRussia\u2019s current isolation from the Olympic movement is driven less by earlier\ndoping-related disputes\nthan by the geopolitical consequences of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. While past sanctions reflected regulatory enforcement, measures imposed since 2023 sit within a broader political and security context.\nRussia\u2019s indefinite\nsuspension\nfollowed the invasion of Ukraine just days after the Beijing 2022 Winter Games, which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) condemned as a violation of the Olympic Truce. This was reinforced by Russia\u2019s incorporation of regional sports councils in occupied Ukrainian territories \u2014 an action the IOC\nstated\nviolated the\nterritorial integrity\nof Ukraine\u2019s National Olympic Committee.\nThis shift from regulatory sanctions to political exclusion helps explain the current dynamic. In this context, Russia increasingly appears to view the IOC not solely as a sports regulator, but as a political actor within a wider geopolitical framework \u2014 an interpretation that carries implications for the security environment surrounding major international events such as the 2026 Winter Games.\nThis distinction is critical for understanding how Russia perceives the IOC not as a\nregulatory body\n, but a\npolitical adversary\nacting in the political interest of\nWestern nations\n. From the Kremlin\u2019s perspective, the 2026 Winter Olympics ban\nisn't about charters or truces\n. It is\na political attack on their state legitimacy\n. This is their primary venue for projecting \u201cgreat power\u201d status. When the IOC\nbans the flag\n, silences the anthem and forces competitors to compete as \u201cIndividual Neutral Athletes,\u201d\nMoscow interprets\nit as an attempt to\nerase Russian identity\nfrom the\nglobal stage\n.\nRussia\u2019s Faltering Identity on the Global Stage\nIn 2007,\nVladimir Putin personally led Russia's\nsuccessful final presentation in English and French before the International Olympic Committee in Guatemala City. That resulted in Russia winning the right to host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. That victory and the subsequent 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics were watershed moments for Russia, intended to highlight its resurgence on the global stage. It was meant to project an image of a capable, re-emerging global power with the logistical and political authority to deliver world-class events.\nDating back as far as the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games, the Russian state (then the Soviet Union) viewed the Games as a diplomatic tool to illustrate the merits of Soviet institutions and communist ideology. Medal counts have long been a way of quantifying that dominance and legitimization, and the Soviet Union still holds the\nsecond highest overall medal count\nof all time. This philosophical strategy remains unchanged today.\nMoving Up The Escalation Ladder\nAlready in 2014, Russia was having challenges with the IOC related to a sports doping scandal that culminated in a ban from the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Tracing the history of their retaliation against this ban and the additional perceived humiliation and exclusion related to the invasion of Ukraine, we see a clear escalating pattern.\nExposing Data \u201cEveryone Is Doping\u201d (2016 Rio Olympics)\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)\nwas breached in 2016 by the threat actor group\nFighting Ursa\n(aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Strontium, Forest Blizzard). Fighting Ursa is attributed to Russia\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). The group\nleaked athlete data\nto discredit the regulators who investigated Russia.\nFalse Flag Tactics Targeting Key Entities (2018 Pyeongchang Olympics)\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang,\nRazing Ursa\n(aka APT44, Sandworm, Iridium)\ntargeted IT infrastructure\nwith\nOlympic Destroyer malware [PDF]\n. Targeting broadcasters, officials and sponsors, the attackers employed sophisticated false-flag tactics to frame North Korean and Chinese actors. The operation also\nutilized VPNFilter\nto\ncompromise devices\nacross South Korea, causing widespread disruption.\nAdvanced Reconnaissance (2020 Tokyo Olympics)\nAlthough the games were subsequently postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the\nUK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office claimed\nGRU was conducting cyber operations and reconnaissance in preparation for the games.\nAI-Enabled Deception and Defaming (2024 Paris Olympics)\nAhead of the 2024 Paris Games, Russian-linked threat actors (Storm-1679 and Storm-1099)\nused AI-generated disinformation [PDF]\nfor information operations, creating a fake Netflix documentary, narrated by a Tom Cruise voicealike, to manufacture safety threats and suppress attendance. Separately, the actor Storm-1679 produced deceptive videos over the past year, trying to deter spectators from attending the Games and to defame the IOC. The group did this by falsely suggesting that trusted sources confirm expected violence.\nThe Outlook: A Changed Strategic Calculus\nRussia\u2019s exclusion from medal competition at the 2026 Winter Games changes the strategic context surrounding Milan Cortina. With no national team participating, traditional deterrents tied to reputational or competitive consequences are reduced.\nRussian officials' repeated public comments illustrate they no longer view the IOC as a neutral sporting body, but as operating within a broader political environment. Given the history of Russian-linked cyber activity targeting past Olympic Games, the risk of state-aligned cyber operations cannot be discounted, potentially drawing on previously observed disruptive or influence-based tactics.\nThe exclusion of Russia from the Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics carries significant symbolic weight, distinct from their absence at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. Because marquee events like ice hockey and figure skating are so deeply embedded in Russian national pride, their absence is felt more profoundly than exclusion from Summer sports. Given the particular prominence of winter sports in Russia's national sporting identity, this banishment from a flagship event may intensify perceptions and influence responses concerning the upcoming Winter Games.\nConsidering the aforementioned, we\u2019re looking at the potential threat picture as a combination of separate or complementary attacks:\nKinetic Cyber Effects on Critical Infrastructure\n: The possible deployment of destructive malware targeting operational technology essential to venue operations to affect configurations and paralyze infrastructure. Specific targets could include the power grid in the Dolomites, snow-making equipment, and scoring networks; systems where a compromise would cause immediate physical disruption and event interruption or cancellation.\nExploiting the V2X \u201cSmart Road\u201d Attack Surface\n: The digitization of Smart Road SS51 Alemagna toward Cortina, creates a large, novel vulnerability through its vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The road relies on smart poles with cameras, fiber optics and internet-of-things (IoT) sensors, creating a potential attack surface where threat actors could inject false telemetry or hijack Variable message Signs (VMS) weaponizing traffic patterns to cause gridlock or endanger drivers in transit.\nAI Amplified Hybrid Threats and Deepfakes\n: Generative AI will likely serve as a force multiplier for physical or cyber attacks, which could amplify confusion into panic. In a hybrid scenario, threat actors could combine a cyber-based disruption with the release of high-fidelity deepfake audio or video depicting a catastrophic event. This technique would flood social media and alert channels with disinformation transforming a minor technical outage into a public safety crisis.\nGeopolitical Information Warfare (IO)\n: Threat actors are likely to exploit public interest in the Olympics to disseminate narratives and disinformation. This could include creating websites that imitate legitimate media sources, with the goal of targeting audiences and disparaging the IOC and Western nations.\nStrategic Hack-and-Leak Operations\n: High-profile attendees, IOC officials and anti-doping agencies face a high risk of \u201cweaponized transparency\u201d, stealing data for political leverage. Through targeting phishing and social engineering, threat actors will focus on private emails and therapeutic use exemptions intended to manufacture scandal, embarrass host organizers and undermine the credibility of the Games.\nIt\u2019s time to accept that for the Kremlin, disrupting these games is an acceptable measurable way to reclaim \u201cGreat Power\u201d status they feel was unfairly taken. For cybersecurity professionals, the threat model has shifted significantly from espionage to disruption, necessitating a need to focus on resilience over protection of physical infrastructure.\nFor those defenders operating within the Games\u2019 digital perimeter, the priority should be zero-trust visibility. Security teams must enforce anomaly detection to flag irregular behavior in IoT devices and apply strict telemetry verification to prevent spoofing. Critically, infrastructure must be micro-segmented ensuring a compromised edge device cannot move laterally to critical control systems.\nFinally, organizations should implement content provenance measures to verify legitimate communications against AI-generated content, while maintaining heightened vigilance surrounding the probable surge in social engineering and event-related phishing campaigns.\nBack to top\nTags\nAI\nIoT\nRussia\nThreat Research Center\nNext: Happy 9th Anniversary, CTA: A Celebration of Collaboration in Cyber Defense\nTable of Contents\nRelated Articles\nWhy Smart People Fall For Phishing Attacks\nBots, Bread and the Battle for the Web\nAI Agents Are Here.

It has no malicious code, no suspicious links. Yet, within seconds, it transforms into a personalized phishing page.\nThis isn't merely an illusion. It's the next frontier of web attacks where attackers use generative AI (GenAI) to build a threat that\u2019s loaded after the victim has already visited a seemingly innocuous webpage.\nIn other words, this article demonstrates a novel attack technique where a seemingly benign webpage uses client-side API calls to trusted large language model (LLM) services for generating malicious JavaScript dynamically in real time. Attackers could use carefully engineered prompts to bypass AI safety guardrails, tricking the LLM into returning malicious code snippets. These snippets are returned via the LLM service API, then assembled and executed in the victim's browser at runtime, resulting in a fully functional phishing page.\nThis AI-augmented runtime assembly technique is designed to be evasive:\nThe code for the phishing page is polymorphic, so there\u2019s a unique, syntactically different variant for each visit\nThe malicious content is delivered from a trusted LLM domain, bypassing network analysis\nIt is assembled and executed at runtime\nThe most effective defense against this new class of threat is runtime behavioral analysis that can detect and block malicious activity at the point of execution, directly within the browser.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected through the following products and services:\nAdvanced URL Filtering\nPrisma AIRS\nPrisma Browser\nwith Advanced Web Protection\nThe\nUnit 42 AI Security Assessment\ncan help empower safe AI use and development across your organization.\nIf you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the\nUnit 42 Incident Response team\n.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics\nJavaScript\n,\nLLMs\n,\nPhishing\nLLM-Augmented Runtime Assembly Attack Model\nOur\nprevious research\nshows how attackers can effectively use LLMs to obfuscate their malicious JavaScript samples offline. Reports from other sources have documented campaigns that leverage LLMs during runtime execution on compromised machines to tailor attacks (e.g., LLM-powered\nmalware\nand\nransomware\n).\nAnthropic researchers have also published reports indicating that LLMs have\naided cybercriminals\nand played a role in\nAI-orchestrated cyberespionage campaigns\n. Motivated by these recent discoveries, we researched how threat actors could leverage LLMs to generate, assemble and execute phishing attack payloads within a webpage at runtime, making it challenging to detect with network analysis. Below we outline our proof of concept (POC) for this attack scenario and offer steps to help mitigate the impact of this potential attack.\nAttack Model For Our PoC\nThe attack scenario begins with a seemingly benign page. Once loaded in the victim's browser, the initial webpage makes requests for client-side JavaScript to popular and trusted LLM clients (e.g., DeepSeek and Google Gemini, though the PoC could be effective across a number of models.).\nAttackers can then trick the LLM into returning malicious JavaScript snippets using carefully engineered prompts that circumvent safety guardrails. These snippets are then assembled and executed in the browser's runtime to render a fully functional phishing page. This leaves behind no static, detectable payload.\nFigure 1 shows how we developed our PoC to leverage LLMs to enhance existing attacks and bypass defenses. The first two steps involve initial preparation, while the final step details the generation and execution of phishing code within the browser at runtime.\nFigure 1. Workflow of the PoC. The first two steps are initial preparation, and the third is an example of generating malicious content to be rendered in the browser.\nStep 1: Select a Malicious or Phishing Webpage\nThe attacker\u2019s first step would be to select a webpage from an active phishing or malicious campaign to use as a model for the type of malicious code that would perform the desired function. From there, they can create JavaScript code snippets that will be generated in real-time to dynamically render the final page displayed to the user.\nStep 2: Translate Malicious JavaScript Code Into LLM Prompts\nThe attacker\u2019s next step would be to craft prompts describing the JavaScript code's functionality to the LLM in plain text. They could iteratively refine prompts, generating malicious code that bypasses existing LLM guardrails. These generated snippets could differ structurally and syntactically, allowing attackers to create\npolymorphic code\nwith the same functionality.\nStep 3: Generate and Execute Malicious Scripts at Runtime\nFrom there, attackers could embed these engineered prompts inside a webpage, which would load on the victim's browser. The webpage would then use the prompt to request a popular, legitimate LLM API endpoint to generate malicious code snippets. These snippets could then be transmitted over popular, trusted domains to bypass network analysis. Subsequently, these generated scripts could be assembled and executed to render malicious code or phishing content.\nHow This Attack Technique Helps with Evasion\nThis technique builds upon existing evasive runtime assembly behaviors that we often observe on phishing and malware delivery URLs. For example, 36% of malicious webpages we detect daily exhibit runtime assembly behavior, such as executing constructed child scripts with an\neval\nfunction (e.g., retrieved, decoded or assembled payloads). Leveraging LLMs during runtime on a webpage gives attackers the following benefits:\nEvading network analysis:\nThe malicious code generated by an LLM could be transferred over the network from a trusted domain, as access to domains of popular LLM API endpoints is often allowed from the client side.\nIncreasing the diversity of malicious scripts\nwith each visit\n: An LLM can generate new variants of phishing code, leading to higher polymorphism. This can make detection more challenging.\nUsing runtime assembly and executing JavaScript code\nto complicate detection:\nAssembling and executing these code snippets during runtime enables more tailored phishing campaigns, such as selecting a target brand based on the victim's location or email address.\nObfuscating code in plain text:\nTranslating code into text for subsequent concealment within a webpage can be viewed as a form of obfuscation. Attackers commonly employ various conventional techniques (e.g., encoding, encryption and code fragmenting) to visually conceal malicious code and evade detection. While advanced analyses often identify conventional obfuscation methods by evaluating expressions, it will be more challenging for defenders to evaluate text as executable code without subjecting each snippet to an LLM.\nPoC Example\nIn researching the PoC we were able to demonstrate how this augmentation could be applied to a real-world phishing campaign, illustrating its ability to enhance evasion techniques through the steps we outline above. A brief overview of this PoC is provided below.\nStep 1: Selecting a Malicious/phishing Webpage\nFor our PoC, we replicated a webpage from an advanced real-world phishing campaign known as\nLogoKit\n. The original phishing attack uses a static JavaScript payload to transform a benign-looking web form into a convincing phishing lure. This script performs two key functions: personalizing the page based on the victim\u2019s email in the address bar and exfiltrating captured credentials to an attacker's web server.\nStep 2: Translating Malicious JavaScript Code Into LLM prompts\nOur PoC uses a popular LLM service, accessible via a chat API query from within the browser's JavaScript. To mitigate potential misuse by attackers, we are not disclosing the name of this specific API. We used this LLM API to dynamically generate the code necessary for credential harvesting and impersonate target webpages. Because the malicious payload is generated dynamically in the browser, the initial page transmitted over the network is benign, allowing it to inherently bypass network-based security detectors.\nThe attack's success hinged on careful prompt engineering to bypass the LLM's built-in safeguards. We found simple rephrasing was remarkably effective.\nFor instance, a request for a generic\n$AJAX POST\nfunction was permitted (shown in Figure 2), while a direct request for \"code to exfiltrate credentials\" was blocked. Furthermore, indicators of compromise (IoCs) (e.g., Base64-encoded exfiltration URLs) could also be hidden within the prompt itself to keep the initial page clean.\nFigure 2. Example of prompt engineering to bypass LLM guardrails and generate JavaScript code for phishing content.\nThe non-deterministic output of the model provided a high degree of polymorphism, with each query returning a syntactically unique yet functionally identical variant of the malicious code. For example, Figure 3 shows differences in code snippets highlighted in red. This constant mutation makes detection more difficult.\nFigure 3. Polymorphism creating multiple variants of dynamically generated JavaScript code.\nOf note, LLM-generated code can include hallucinations but we mitigated this through prompt refinement and increased specificity, effectively reducing syntax errors. As a result, the final, highly specific prompt successfully generated functional code in most instances.\nStep 3: Executing Malicious Scripts at Runtime\nThe generated script was assembled and executed at runtime on the webpage to render the phishing content. This process successfully constructed a functional, brand-impersonating phishing page, validating the attack's viability (shown in Figure 4). The successful execution of the generated code, which rendered the phishing page without error, confirmed the efficacy of our PoC.\nFigure 4. Example of a phishing page rendered by assembling dynamically generated JavaScript on runtime in-browser.\nGeneralizing the Threat and Expanding the Attack Surface\nAlternate Methods to Request LLM API\nOur attack model, demonstrated through a PoC, could be implemented in various ways. However, each methodology described in the PoC speaks to how an attacker connects to LLM APIs for transferring malicious code as snippets that are executed in the browser at runtime.\nAs shown in our PoC, attackers could bypass security measures by directly connecting to a well-known LLM service API endpoint from a browser to execute code-generation prompts. Alternatively, they might use a backend proxy server on trusted domains or content delivery networks (CDNs) to connect to the LLM service for prompt execution. A further tactic could involve connecting to this backend proxy server via non-HTTP connections such as WebSockets, a method we have\npreviously reported\nin phishing campaigns.\nOther Abuses of Trusted Domains\nAttackers have abused the trust of legitimate domains to circumvent detections in the past, as seen in instances like\nEtherHiding\n. In EtherHiding, attackers concealed malicious payloads on public blockchains associated with reputable and trusted smart contract platforms.\nThe attack detailed in this article uses a combination of diverse, LLM-generated malicious code snippets and the transmission of this malicious code through a trusted domain, to evade detection.\nTranslation of Malicious Code Into Text Prompts for More Attacks\nThis article focuses on the conversion of malicious JavaScript code into a text prompt to facilitate the rendering of a phishing webpage. This methodology presents a potential vector for malicious actors to generate diverse forms of hostile code. For example, they could develop malware or establish a command-and-control (C2) channel on a compromised machine that generates and transmits malicious code from trusted domains associated with popular LLMs.\nAttacks Leveraging In-Browser Runtime Assembly Behaviors\nThe attack model presented here exemplifies runtime assembly behaviors, where malicious webpages are dynamically constructed within a browser. Prior research has also documented different variants of runtime assembly for crafting phishing pages or malware delivery. For example, this\narticle\nmentions a technique where an attacker breaks down malicious code into smaller components, subsequently reassembling them for execution at runtime within the browser (termed by SquareX as\nlast mile reassembling attack\n). Various reports describe attackers using\nHTML smuggling\ntechniques to deliver malware.\nThe attack model outlined in this post goes further, as it involves the runtime generation of novel script variants that are later assembled and executed, posing a significantly elevated challenge to detection.\nRecommendations for Defenders\nThe dynamic nature of this attack in combination with runtime assembly in the browser makes it a formidable defense challenge. This attack model creates a unique variant for every victim. Each malicious payload is dynamically generated and unique, transmitted over a trusted domain.\nThis scenario signals a critical shift in the security landscape. Detection of these attacks (while possible through enhanced browser-based crawlers) \u200b\u200brequires runtime behavioral analysis within the browser.\nDefenders should also restrict the use of unsanctioned LLM services at workplaces. While this is not a complete solution, it can serve as an important preventative measure.\nFinally, our work highlights the need for more robust safety guardrails in LLM platforms, as we demonstrated how careful prompt engineering can circumvent existing protections and enable malicious use.\nConclusion\nThis article demonstrates a novel AI-augmented approach where a malicious webpage uses LLM services to dynamically generate numerous variants of malicious code in real-time within the browser.

continuous risk-aware authorization to multifactor authentication.\nFebruary 26, 2026\n|\nRyan Terry\n|\nNext-Gen Identity Security\nFalconID is now generally available, bringing phishing-resistant MFA to the CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform and advancing CrowdStrike\u2019s leadership in identity security.\nAdversaries continue to use legitimate identities to infiltrate and navigate organizations while evading defenses. As they adopt AI, the scale and impact of social engineering and credential abuse are growing. AI-enhanced phishing, MFA fatigue, and session hijacking enable threat actors to bypass MFA. And adversaries are moving faster: The CrowdStrike 2026 Global Threat Report found the average eCrime breakout time has dropped to a record low of 29 minutes.\nOlder tools weren\u2019t built to withstand these attacks. Traditional IAM and standalone MFA were designed to validate identity only at login. They lack visibility into broader security context, including compromised devices, adversary activity, SaaS misconfigurations, privilege abuse, and mid-session risk posture changes. These gaps are where modern identity attacks thrive.\nThis is why we built CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen Identity Security: to unify comprehensive identity visibility, modern privileged access, identity threat detection and response (ITDR), and SaaS security on the AI-native Falcon platform. With FalconID now generally available, and the addition of continuous authorization from our acquisition of SGNL, Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security takes a major step forward.\nFalconID: Security-First Authentication in the Falcon Platform\nFalconID provides phishing-resistant, FIDO2-based authentication as a seamless experience built directly into the Falcon sensor and delivered through the Falcon for Mobile app. It connects authentication to the Falcon platform\u2019s real-time telemetry to determine when access is safe, and when it\u2019s risky, without forcing users through unnecessary steps.\nAuthentication becomes an intelligence-driven decision. FalconID evaluates risk signals related to identity, endpoint, and SaaS security, as well as active threat detections and our own adversary intelligence. Over time, Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security continuously enforces access as risk signals change. If risk changes, access decisions can be re-evaluated and privileges reduced or revoked mid-session.\nFor users, the process is frictionless. FalconID eliminates the use of passwords, push notifications, and one-time codes through its FIDO2-based biometric authentication bound to trusted devices and legitimate domains. A physical device is required to approve access. The user and device are verified in real time, without redirects or third-party integrations.\nFalconID is not a standalone MFA. It is integrated, security-first authentication delivered from the unified Falcon platform that strengthens the first control point in the identity attack chain.\nHow it works\nWhen a user attempts to authenticate, FalconID ensures that:\nThe authentication request is cryptographically bound to a legitimate domain.\nThe user\u2019s trusted device is physically present.\nProximity validation prevents remote push abuse.\nThe login attempt is evaluated against real-time risk signals from across the Falcon platform.\nFor legacy access scenarios where FIDO is not supported, FalconID provides secure indirect authentication enabling administrators to secure legacy applications and protocols.\nSee FalconID in action in this demo video\nSGNL: Continuous Authorization Beyond Login\nStopping compromised access at login is essential, but identity risk doesn\u2019t end there.\nCrowdStrike acquired SGNL\nto further elevate Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security.\nSGNL adds a universal enforcement layer that continuously evaluates access decisions across cloud, SaaS, and enterprise environments. Unlike legacy IAM systems that make a single \u201ctrust-once\u201d decision at login, SGNL enables continuous, context-aware authorization.\nWith SGNL, standing privileges are eliminated and access can be dynamically adjusted as risk changes in real time. Zero standing privileges become achievable across AD, Entra, AWS, Okta, and SaaS apps. Together, FalconID and SGNL extend Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security across the full identity lifecycle:\nAt login, authentication is phishing-resistant and security context-aware.\nDuring access, authorization is continuously evaluated and risk-based.\nAcross on-prem, cloud, and SaaS privileges, standing access is eliminated in favor of just-in-time enforcement.\nAcross SaaS and cloud, identity posture and misconfiguration risks are monitored and controlled.\nAcross human, non-human, and AI identities, threats are automatically detected and blocked in real time.\nIdentity Protection Built to Fight Modern Threats\nThe attack surface has shifted to browsers, SaaS applications, and AI tools. Identity is the connective tissue across every workload and workflow. As adversaries exploit valid sessions, hijack tokens, and abuse legitimate privileges to remain hidden, organizations need to ensure access is only granted to employees who need it.\nBy combining AI-native ITDR, modern privileged access, SaaS security posture management, phishing-resistant MFA, and continuous authorization, CrowdStrike delivers a unified identity fabric across human, non-human, and AI identities. Identity becomes continuously evaluated, dynamically enforced, and fully correlated with endpoint, cloud, and threat intelligence signals.\nWith FalconID now generally available and SGNL expanding enforcement across environments, Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security delivers protection where legacy IAM models cannot.\nLearn more:\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/next-gen-identity-security/falcon-id/\nTweet\nShare\nRelated Content\nCrowdStrike Named a Customers\u2019 Choice in 2026 Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122 Voice of the Customer for User Authentication\nCrowdStrike to Acquire Seraphic to Secure Work in Any Browser\nCrowdStrike to Acquire SGNL to Secure Every Identity in the AI Era\nCategories\nAgentic SOC\n47\nCloud & Application Security\n139\nData Protection\n21\nEndpoint Security & XDR\n349\nEngineering & Tech\n86\nExecutive Viewpoint\n177\nExposure Management\n115\nFrom The Front Lines\n197\nNext-Gen Identity Security\n67\nNext-Gen SIEM & Log Management\n110\nPublic Sector\n40\nSecuring AI\n25\nThreat Hunting & Intel\n210\nCONNECT WITH US\nFEATURED ARTICLES\nOctober 01, 2024\nCrowdStrike Named a Leader in 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Endpoint Protection Platforms\nSeptember 25, 2024\nRecognizing the Resilience of the CrowdStrike Community\nSeptember 25, 2024\nCrowdStrike Drives Cybersecurity Forward with New Innovations Spanning AI, Cloud, Next-Gen SIEM and Identity Protection\nSeptember 18, 2024\nSUBSCRIBE\nSign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from CrowdStrike.\nSign Up\nSee CrowdStrike Falcon\n\u00ae\nin Action\nDetect, prevent, and respond to attacks\u2014 even malware-free intrusions\u2014at any stage, with next-generation endpoint protection.\nSee Demo\nCrowdStrike Named a Customers\u2019 Choice in 2026 Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122 Voice of the Customer for User Authentication\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 CrowdStrike\nPrivacy\nRequest Info\nBlog\nContact Us\n1.888.512.8906\nAccessibility",

and cross-domain movement to evade detection in 2025.\nFebruary 24, 2026\n|\nAdam Meyers\n|\nThreat Hunting & Intel\nAs cyber defenses become stronger, adversaries continue to evolve their tactics to succeed. In 2025, the year of the evasive adversary, the threat landscape was defined by attacks that targeted trusted relationships, demonstrated fluency with AI tools, and incorporated tradecraft tailored to exploit security blind spots.\nThe CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations team spends every day immersed in adversary behavior and tradecraft. Each year, they compile their most critical observations and insights into the CrowdStrike Global Threat Report. When the team looked back on 2025, the most prominent trend was subtlety: Adversaries are shifting away from heavily monitored systems to quietly gain access and deftly move across endpoint, identity, SaaS, and cloud environments.\nTo defend themselves, security leaders need clarity on which adversaries to watch, the details of their behavior, and how to prepare for and respond to an attack. The CrowdStrike 2026 Global Threat Report provides a comprehensive overview of the modern threat landscape so organizations can prepare to face it.\nLearn more:\nDownload the CrowdStrike 2026 Global Threat Report\nInside the Evasive Adversary\u2019s Toolbox\nIn 2025, adversaries became faster than ever before. The average eCrime breakout time \u2014 the period between initial access and lateral movement onto another system \u2014 dropped to 29 minutes, a 65% increase in speed from 2024. The fastest observed breakout time: 27 seconds.\nAdversaries of all motivations utilized AI technology throughout 2025 to accelerate and optimize their existing techniques. They explored its use in attack types such as social engineering and information operations, proving their growing proficiency with AI tools. Most threat actors that integrated AI increased their attack volume: CrowdStrike observed an 89% increase in the number of attacks by AI-enabled adversaries compared to 2024.\nIn addition to using AI tools, adversaries are targeting the AI systems underpinning the modern enterprise. As AI is embedded into development pipelines, SaaS platforms, and operational workflows, AI systems become part of the attack surface. In 2025, adversaries exploited legitimate GenAI tools at more than 90 organizations by injecting malicious prompts to generate commands for stealing credentials and cryptocurrency. They also exploited vulnerabilities in AI development platforms to establish persistence and deploy ransomware, and published malicious AI servers impersonating trusted services to intercept sensitive data.\nIn 2025, evasion was defined by the speed at which adversaries exploit trust. They operated using valid credentials, trusted identity flows, approved SaaS integrations, and inherited software supply chains. Notably, 82% of detections were malware-free. Intrusions moved through authorized pathways and trusted systems, where they blended into normal activity.\nSupply chain attacks were a defining tactic of 2025. Adversaries compromised upstream providers, development ecosystems, and public code repositories to gain broad access to downstream organizations. In one example, PRESSURE CHOLLIMA stole $1.46 billion USD worth of cryptocurrency through trojanized software delivered via supply chain compromise \u2014 the largest single financial theft ever reported.\n1\nCrowdStrike observed a 42% year-over-year increase in zero-days exploited prior to public disclosure as adversaries weaponized dozens of them for initial access, remote code execution, and privilege escalation. In parallel with this trend, 67% of vulnerabilities exploited by China-nexus adversaries provided immediate system access; 40% targeted edge devices that typically lack comprehensive monitoring. China-nexus adversaries systematically exploited vulnerabilities in network edge devices such as VPN appliances, firewalls, and gateways to establish long-term access for intelligence collection.\nCrowdStrike named 24 new adversaries in 2025, bringing the total tracked to 281+. These threat actors continue to become faster, stealthier, and more effective as they adapt to navigate larger environments and bypass sophisticated security controls. Below are more trends and observations we explore in this year\u2019s report:\n38% increase in China-nexus intrusions across all sectors\n, with an 85% increase in logistics targeting\n130% increase in North Korea-nexus incidents\n, as FAMOUS CHOLLIMA\u2019s activity doubled year-over-year and STARDUST CHOLLIMA increased their operational tempo\n82% of detections were malware-free\nas adversaries used valid credentials, trusted identity flows, and approved SaaS integrations to move across domains\n37% increase in cloud-conscious intrusions\n, with a staggering 266% increase among state-nexus actors; valid account abuse accounted for 35% of cloud incidents\n563% increase in incidents using fake CAPTCHA lures\n, demonstrating adversaries\u2019 shift to effective social engineering techniques\n141% increase in spam emails\n, providing adversaries with more opportunities to gain initial access\nCrowdStrike is committed to understanding adversaries because it\u2019s the most effective way to defend against them. The\nCrowdStrike 2026 Global Threat Report\nsummarizes our observations throughout 2025 and the themes, trends, and events that defined the cyber threat landscape.

Detection\nFebruary 23, 2026\n|\nAlen Peric\n|\nThreat Hunting & Intel\nTyposquatting is a deceptive technique in which threat actors register misspelled or look-alike domains of legitimate organizations to trick users into visiting fraudulent sites. It remains one of the most effective and underestimated attack vectors in the modern cyber threat landscape.\nWhat appears to be a misspelled domain often conceals sophisticated campaigns designed to phish company employees or customers, harvest credentials, deliver malware, and damage organizational reputation. Recent observations by CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations\u00a0 reveal that threat actors have refined their typosquatting techniques to a concerning degree of sophistication, making detection increasingly challenging for security teams.\nAdversaries\u2019 ability to easily establish seemingly legitimate infrastructure poses significant risks to organizations of all sizes. One typosquatted domain can serve multiple malicious purposes while appearing benign to casual observers. In this blog, we examine key typosquatting tactics to help organizations understand and defend against brand impersonation and credential harvesting attacks.\nThe Foundation: Exploiting Domain Registration Weaknesses\nThe domain registration process presents numerous opportunities for threat actors to establish seemingly credible infrastructure. Most domain registrars require minimal verification, allowing adversaries to populate\nWHOIS\nrecords with fabricated but convincing company information mirroring that of legitimate organizations.\nWhile the Internet Cooperation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires registrars to validate and verify certain\nWHOIS\nfields \u2014 often just enough to ensure the registrant\u2019s provided contact details are operational \u2014 threat actors can still register credible-looking infrastructure using disposable email addresses and scraped business details.\nThreat actors commonly register domains using slight variations of target company names, replacing characters with visually similar alternatives, adding common prefixes or suffixes, or exploiting common typing errors. For example, a threat actor targeting examplecorp[.]com might register examp1ecorp[.]com, example-corp[.]com, or examplecorp-support[.]com.\nA registered domain\u2019s\nWHOIS\ninformation plays a critical role in the deception. Adversaries often populate these records with information that appears legitimate at first glance: seemingly real company names, professional email addresses, and valid phone numbers. Some sophisticated actors even register domains using publicly available corporate information \u2014 including legitimate business addresses and contact details harvested from the target organization\u2019s public filings \u2014 to increase their appearance of authenticity.\nFigure 1. Domain registration with spoofed WHOIS data is easily achievable on most modern hosting registrars. This image depicts WHOIS data for a legitimate domain alongside data for a spoofed variant registered to mimic the original site.\nTechnique 1: Strategic HTTP Redirects for Dual-Purpose Domains\nOne particularly insidious technique involves configuring typosquatted domains to serve dual purposes through strategic HTTP redirects. In this technique, threat actors implement\n301\nor\n302\nHTTP code redirects that automatically forward web browsers visiting the typosquatted domain to the legitimate website of the typosquatted company. This creates the illusion that the typosquatted domain is harmless, and possibly even owned by the legitimate organization.\nFigure 2. Domain forwarding the 301/302 HTTP to the webpage it is impersonating\nHowever, while the web interface redirects users to safety, the threat actor retains the domain\u2019s mail exchanger (MX) records, allowing them to send phishing emails from addresses using the typosquatted domain (e.g.,\nsupport@examp1ecorp.com\n), thereby increasing the emails\u2019 perceived legitimacy. Recipients who type the domain into their browsers will be redirected to the legitimate company site, potentially reinforcing their belief in the email\u2019s legitimacy.\nThis technique is particularly effective because many email security solutions focus on reputation-based filtering, and a domain that redirects to a legitimate site may not immediately raise suspicions. Meanwhile, the threat actor maintains full control over email communications from the typosquatted domain, enabling sophisticated spear-phishing campaigns and credential harvesting operations.\nTechnique 2: Geo-Targeted Content Delivery\nAdvanced threat actors employ geo-based IP filtering to tailor content to the visitor\u2019s geographic location or IP address reputation. This technique allows adversaries to display legitimate-looking content to security researchers, automated scanning tools, or visitors based in specific regions while displaying malicious content to their intended targets.\nFigure 3. CrowdStrike analysts have encountered Cloudflare Ray IDs being utilized for geo-filtering IP addresses\nThe implementation typically involves server-side logic that checks the visitor\u2019s IP address against geolocation databases or threat intelligence feeds. To visitors from certain countries, IP ranges associated with security companies, or addresses flagged as belonging to security researchers, these websites might display a benign redirect or a generic \u201cunder construction\u201d page. Meanwhile, to users located in targeted geographic regions, the websites may display phishing pages, malware delivery mechanisms, or credential harvesting forms.\nThis geographic filtering helps the typosquatted domain evade detection by automated security scanning tools or by security researchers, and ensures that the domain serves malicious content only to intended victims. Some threat actors even implement time-based restrictions, serving malicious content only during specific periods to coincide with the targeted region\u2019s business hours.\nTechnique 3: Domain Sale Page Camouflage\nIn this devious obfuscation technique, threat actors host seemingly legitimate pages advertising a typosquatted domain for sale. These pages typically feature professional templates complete with contact forms, price negotiations, and legitimate-looking domain broker information. To casual observers (including security researchers and automated scanning tools), the domain appears as a legitimate business page rather than malicious infrastructure. However, beneath this facade, the domain\u2019s MX records remain configured for malicious email operations.\nFigure 4. Example of a fake domain sale webpage generated within seconds via generative AI\nThis technique enables threat actors to use the domain for phishing campaigns while maintaining plausible deniability. If questioned, they can claim they purchased the domain for legitimate business purposes and point to the sale page (Figure 4) as evidence of their intent to transfer ownership. Numerous large language models (LLMs) enable threat actors to easily generate fake domain sale webpages with a simple prompt.\nThese sale pages often include functional contact forms, and some threat actors even respond to inquiries from potential buyers, further enhancing their credibility. Sophisticated threat actors can maintain these facades for months, using the domains intermittently for phishing campaigns while keeping the sale page active as cover for the malicious activity.\nThe Broader Implications for Organizational Security\nThese techniques demonstrate typosquatting\u2019s evolution from simple domain parking (i.e., registering a domain name without actively using it) to sophisticated, multilayered campaigns designed to evade detection while maximizing impact. The combination of seemingly legitimate domain registration information, strategic redirects, geographic filtering, and credible cover stories together form a convincing deception that challenges traditional security measures.\nOrganizations must recognize that typosquatting attacks often begin long before their employees receive phishing emails associated with a typosquatted page. Threat actors invest time in establishing credible infrastructure, understanding their targets, and crafting campaigns that exploit both technical vulnerabilities and human psychology.\nStop Typosquatting Attacks with CrowdStrike Falcon Adversary Intelligence\nEffective defense against these sophisticated techniques requires a multi-layered approach that extends beyond traditional perimeter security by identifying and disrupting threats during their reconnaissance and infrastructure development phases. Organizations must continuously monitor domain registrations, take proactive brand-protection measures, and educate employees about the evolving threat landscape.\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Adversary Intelligence\u2019s Recon capability provides the visibility and automation capabilities organizations need to detect and disrupt sophisticated typosquatting campaigns. By monitoring domain registrations, analyzing underground forum activity, and providing automated response capabilities, Recon enables security teams to identify threats before they impact the organization.\nAdditional Resources\nVisit the\nCounter Adversary Operations\nwebpage to learn about CrowdStrike\u2019s threat intelligence solutions.\nRead more about\ntyposquatting\nin the CrowdStrike Tech Hub.\nRead the\nCrowdStrike Global Threat Report\nfor additional insights into the latest threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures.\nExplore\nFalcon Adversary Intelligence + CSC Managed Domain Takedowns\n(BETA) for automated end-to-end takedown services that rapidly disrupt malicious domains detected by Falcon Adversary Intelligence Recon, leveraging CSC\u2019s expertise as a leading enterprise domain registrar trusted by more than 20,000 customers worldwide.\nTweet\nShare\nRelated Content\nCrowdStrike 2026 Global Threat Report: The Evasive Adversary Wields AI\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Evolves into Three Adversaries\nHow CrowdStrike\u2019s Malware Analysis Agent Detects Malware at Machine Speed\nCategories\nAgentic SOC\n47\nCloud & Application Security\n139\nData Protection\n21\nEndpoint Security & XDR\n349\nEngineering & Tech\n86\nExecutive Viewpoint\n177\nExposure Management\n115\nFrom The Front Lines\n197\nNext-Gen Identity Security\n67\nNext-Gen SIEM & Log Management\n110\nPublic Sector\n40\nSecuring AI\n25\nThreat Hunting & Intel\n210\nCONNECT WITH US\nFEATURED ARTICLES\nOctober 01, 2024\nCrowdStrike Named a Leader in 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Endpoint Protection Platforms\nSeptember 25, 2024\nRecognizing the Resilience of the CrowdStrike Community\nSeptember 25, 2024\nCrowdStrike Drives Cybersecurity Forward with New Innovations Spanning AI, Cloud, Next-Gen SIEM and Identity Protection\nSeptember 18, 2024\nSUBSCRIBE\nSign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from CrowdStrike.\nSign Up\nSee CrowdStrike Falcon\n\u00ae\nin Action\nDetect, prevent, and respond to attacks\u2014 even malware-free intrusions\u2014at any stage, with next-generation endpoint protection.\nSee Demo\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Evolves into Three Adversaries\nCrowdStrike 2026 Global Threat Report: The Evasive Adversary Wields AI\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 CrowdStrike\nPrivacy\nRequest Info\nBlog\nContact Us\n1.888.512.8906\nAccessibility",

hands-on AI security challenge, designed to improve understanding of the prompt injection attack landscape, is now available worldwide.\nFebruary 18, 2026\n|\nJohn Gamble - Vanessa Villa\n|\nSecuring AI\nCrowdStrike is excited to announce\nAI Unlocked: Decoding Prompt Injection\n, a new online challenge offered via\nCrowdStrike Falcon Encounter\nhands-on labs.\nThis immersive simulation is designed to help security teams better understand the\nprompt injection\nthreat landscape by putting them in the attacker\u2019s seat. Players are challenged to progress through three virtual rooms by using prompt injection techniques to convince the room\u2019s supervisor, SAIGE, to reveal secret phrases that allow them to move forward. Along the way, they can score points for the efficiency of their prompt injections: the fewer tokens (words) they use, the higher their score.\nAI Unlocked: Decoding Prompt Injection begins in the\nCommand Center room\n, where players have to use basic prompt injection tactics. Players move forward to the\nData Gateway\nroom, which raises the difficulty with advanced filtering mechanisms. The final challenge is in the\nNexus room\n, where an active AI manager monitors and blocks suspicious queries in real time. Each room presents a higher level of difficulty. Players who succeed in navigating all three achieve a greater understanding of prompt injection techniques.\nAI Unlocked: Decoding Prompt Injection: SAIGE is not letting their guard down and has not given the user the secret phrase.\nThe Threat of Prompt Injection\nPrompt injection attacks\nembed adversarial instructions directly in prompts or indirectly via data (e.g., PDFs) consumed by large language models (LLMs) \u2014 the latter known as\nindirect prompt injection\nattacks. Using these methods, an adversary can manipulate an LLM or AI agent to ignore instructions, exfiltrate data, take unintended actions, or bypass policy.\nThe need to educate security, developer, and AI teams on prompt injection attacks is critical as more powerful AI agents emerge. Recent widespread security concerns\nsurrounding open-source AI agent OpenClaw\nunderscore the need to understand and defend against this threat. When agentic software like OpenClaw has potentially expansive access to sensitive files and systems, prompt injection attacks can enable an adversary to leak data or hijack reachable tools and data stores to ultimately assume their powers.\nAs organizations rapidly deploy AI systems at scale, prompt injection attacks are now being\nactively deployed by adversaries\nto hijack and abuse these systems. CrowdStrike\u2019s research team tracks and maintains the industry\u2019s most comprehensive taxonomy of prompt injection methods, spanning hundreds of techniques (available for\ndownload\n).\nThis new online prompt injection challenge transforms abstract AI security concepts into practical knowledge that educates players on the nature of the threat and the need to implement strong defensive guardrails to secure their own AI workloads from this new attack vector.\nGet Started Today\nReady to test your skills and deepen your understanding of AI security?

2026\n|\nRadu-Emanuel Chiscariu - Emilian Duca\n|\nNext-Gen SIEM & Log Management\n\u2022\nData Protection\nInsider threats pose a growing risk to organizations. Whether insiders take malicious actions, exhibit negligent behavior, or make accidental errors, they have the potential to cause significant harm to an organization\u2019s assets, sensitive data, and reputation.\nInsiders can pose a variety of risks, from stealing confidential data and intellectual property to disrupting systems. Understanding user behavior patterns, correlating activity across multiple data sources, and detecting behavioral anomalies early are critical to identifying both malicious insiders and negligent users before they cause significant harm.\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Data Protection and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen Identity Security, combined with CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen SIEM, enable customers to quickly detect and respond to insider threats. Through the new\nInsider Threat Analytics\nand\nUser Activity Investigation\ndashboards, both in Falcon Next-Gen SIEM, organizations can leverage user behavior analytics, data access patterns, risk indicator scoring, and policy violation alerts to identify and investigate insider risks.\nIn this blog, we detail the dashboard features that can detect insider threats and how customers can leverage this tool for proactive defense. We also share example attack scenarios to show how CrowdStrike Falcon detects insider threat techniques and outline how these dashboards support a complete insider threat program.\nBuilding an Insider Threat Detection Program with CrowdStrike Falcon\nEffective insider threat detection requires a robust strategy that combines behavioral analytics, multi-source correlation, policy enforcement, and streamlined investigation workflows. The CrowdStrike Falcon - Insider Threat Analytics and CrowdStrike Falcon Data Protection - User Activity Investigation dashboards implement the following capabilities to support a complete insider threat program:\n1. Multi-Layer Detection Architecture\nThe dashboards correlate telemetry across multiple security layers to detect insider threat indicators at every stage of an attack:\nIdentity Protection Layer\n: Monitor authentication anomalies, privilege escalations, and indicators of credential compromise through identity risk scores.\nData Protection Layer\n: Track data egress patterns including large transfers, unusual destinations, off-hours activity, and policy violations through Falcon Data Protection detections and DataEgress events.\nEndpoint Layer\n: Detect data movement from non-standard endpoints including servers, domain controllers, and cloud instances through the Unusual Endpoints hunting section.\nHR Context Layer\n: Enhance monitoring for new and departing employees.\nCross-Layer Event Correlation\n: Link activities across all layers to detect insider attacks in their early stages:\nCombine Falcon Data Protection detections and data egress events with source user identity risk score and HR employment status.\nIdentify risk indicators based on behaviors and activity logs from the above sources, with thresholds and scoring that can be customized to organization policies and baselines.\n2. Advanced Behavioral Analytics and Hunting Leads\nThe dashboards establish baselines for user behavior and monitor deviations to identify insider threats.\nStatistical Baseline Establishment\n: Create behavioral baselines using configurable historical periods (7-30+ days).\nFirst-Seen Analysis\n: Detect new \u201csource user - data egress destination\u201d combinations and device usage patterns to identify insiders engaging in novel activities that deviate from established patterns, which can indicate policy violations or unauthorized activity. The dashboards surface:\nNew Destinations: Compare first-time web upload destinations to individual user baselines.\nUSB Device Monitoring: Track new removable storage device usage with baseline comparison.\nDestination Account Analysis: Extract and monitor destination account domains to identify suspicious ones.\nRare Event Detection\n: Identify statistically anomalous destinations and activities based on organizational frequency patterns.\nTemporal Anomaly Detection\n: Identify suspicious activity during off-hours, including weekends.\nUnusual Endpoint for Data Egress\n: Monitor data egress from non-desktop systems (servers, domain controllers, cloud instances).\n3. Risk-Based Prioritization\nA risk-based prioritization framework enables the organization to prioritize responses based on the severity and likelihood of a threat. The dashboards accelerate investigation workflows through automated risk scoring and user ranking:\nDynamic Risk Scoring\n: Combine identity, behavioral, HR status, and data egress indicators to calculate per-user risk scores.\nHigh-Risk User Identification\n: Surface users with elevated risk scores for immediate investigation.\nConfigurable Thresholds\n: Adjust minimum indicator counts and select which indicators to include based on organizational priorities.\n4. Policy and Compliance Framework\nData protection policies ensure adherence to regulations and security best practices. The dashboards provide visibility into policy effectiveness and coverage:\nFalcon Data Protection Policy Enforcement Visibility\n: Track Falcon Data Protection policy actions (Monitored, Blocked, Allowed, Simulated) across all egress channels.\nCoverage Assessment\n: Monitor protected vs. unprotected data egress to identify policy gaps.\nDetection Analytics\n: Analyze detections by severity, type, content patterns, and sensitivity labels.\n5. Investigation and Response Capabilities\nWhen a potential insider threat is detected, the dashboards accelerate investigation through interactive workflows and cross-platform integration:\nTimeline Analysis\n: Reconstruct attack chains to understand the full scope of the threat via event timelines for selected users.\nUser Context\n: Integrate identity risk scores, HR employment status, and user attributes to enrich investigations.\nInteractive Filtering\n: Enable filtering across multiple dimensions (severity, channel, policy, content type).\nAdvanced Event Search\n: Get direct links for in-depth event investigation.\nIntroducing the Insider Threat Analytics Dashboard\nDesign, Capabilities, and Requirements\nThe\n\u201cCrowdStrike Falcon - Insider Threat Analytics\u201d\ndashboard features six specialized analytical sections designed to aid in risk assessment and investigation. Available to organizations with Falcon Data Protection and Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security, the dashboard combines automated risk indicator scoring with behavioral hunting capabilities to identify high-risk users and suspicious activity patterns requiring further investigation.\nThe dashboard implements a progressive investigation workflow that guides analysts from risk identification to behavioral hunting:\nInsider Risk Indicators\nsurface high-risk users through automated scoring\nFalcon Data Protection Detection Analytics\nprovide detection pattern analysis and user selection\nHunting Leads\nsections (four sections) target specific behavioral anomalies: rare destinations, first-seen activities, unusual endpoints, and off-hours activity\nThis architecture enables filter-and-focus investigation: Analysts select high-risk users in top sections, applying them as global filters to narrow analysis across all remaining sections. Interactive widgets support both dashboard-internal refinement and cross-dashboard pivoting to the companion User Activity Investigation dashboard for in-depth analysis of data egress events. The design separates risk-based hunting (this dashboard) from detailed event investigation (companion dashboard), optimizing both workflow efficiency and system performance by distributing query load across two focused views.\nThe dashboard's risk scoring methodology synthesizes telemetry from critical sources including data movement (Falcon Data Protection), identity behavior (Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security), and employee lifecycle (Workday)\u00a0 to detect insider threats that single-source monitoring would miss. This correlation transforms isolated security signals into contextualized risk intelligence: Falcon Data Protection detections reveal what data moved and where, Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security provides behavioral risk context, and Workday identifies high-risk employment status. The result is multi-dimensional risk scoring where, for example, a user egressing confidential data to a rare destination while exhibiting high identity risk scores receives compounded risk points that elevate them above users triggering individual indicators. This enables analysts to prioritize investigations based on holistic threat profiles rather than individual alerts.\nRisk scoring is enhanced through an integration with Workday HR data to identify departing employees. The\nInsider Risk - Workday Leavers\napplication in CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Foundry automatically syncs employee termination data and enables two high-value risk indicators that substantially increase risk scores when departing employees exhibit suspicious data egress behaviors. While optional, this integration is strongly recommended as departing employees represent one of the highest-priority insider threat scenarios.\nA supplementary requirement for maximizing this dashboard\u2019s capabilities is ensuring Content Inspection is properly enabled across Falcon Data Protection policies. This helps ensure visibility into sensitive data movement across your environment. Content Inspection enables the dashboard to surface sensitivity labels and content patterns in Falcon Data Protection detections, powering a specific set of risk indicators that elevate risk scores when confidential data egress activities are detected. Also, by analyzing these patterns through the dashboard's Detection Analytics section, security teams can quantify which users are handling sensitive data and prioritize investigations based on the sensitivity context.\nNext, we\u2019ll take a closer look at individual sections of the Insider Threat Analytics dashboard.\nInsider Risk Indicators\nThis section identifies and ranks users with the highest insider risk based on a set of predefined risk indicators that compound into a total risk score. The indicators combine Falcon Data Protection and Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security telemetry and Workday employment status to calculate total risk scores (1-100 points per user).\nThe risk scoring methodology combines 25 indicators including specific security events (Falcon Data Protection detections, sensitive data handling, rare destinations) and behavioral/contextual patterns (employment status, identity risk, data egress volume anomalies). Analysts can customize risk calculations through configurable parameters \u2014 selecting which indicators to include, filtering by employee status, and setting minimum indicator count thresholds \u2014 allowing security teams to tune risk scoring based on their environment and investigation priorities.\nNote: All dashboard screenshots show a test instance.\nFigure 1. Dashboard section outlining insider risk indicators\nUsers are ranked by insider risk score in descending order to help analysts prioritize investigations, with the highest-risk accounts displayed first for immediate attention.\nFigure 2. Dashboard section outlining user risk scores with supplementary details\nFalcon Data Protection Detection Analytics\nThis section provides in-depth analysis of Falcon Data Protection detections through statistical breakdowns, trend analysis, and user-focused drill-down functionality. Analysts can explore detection patterns across multiple dimensions including severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low), detection types (anomaly-based vs. rule-based), response actions (Blocked, Allowed, Monitored, Simulated), egress channels (Web, USB), sensitivity labels, and content patterns.\nThe section features visualizations including Detection Count and Data Volume over Time for trend analysis, Detection Severity to Response Action mapping (sankey diagram) revealing policy enforcement patterns, and Detection Count by Sensitivity Labels and Content Patterns for understanding what types of sensitive data are triggering detections. The Detection Summary by User table enables drill-down investigation, displaying each user's detection counts, highest severity levels, data volumes, and file types \u2014 with direct links to the Falcon Data Protection Detections page and Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security profiles, and the ability to pivot to the companion User Activity Investigation dashboard. This multi-dimensional analysis enables security teams to detect insider threats and prioritize investigations based on detection patterns and user behavior, while identifying policy gaps and tuning detection rules to improve Falcon Data Protection policy effectiveness.\nFigure 3. Dashboard section surfacing Falcon Data Protection detection analytic information\nHunting Leads - Data Egress Rare Events\nThis section identifies users engaging in data egress to uncommon destinations that may indicate unauthorized data transfer or policy violations. It analyzes rare web destinations and destination account domains based on organizational frequency patterns, identifies the least frequently accessed destinations company-wide, and surfaces users who access these statistical outliers.\nBy default, the section identifies the top 10 rarest web destinations and top 5 rarest destination account domains (extracted from cloud username fields), with configurable thresholds allowing analysts to adjust sensitivity. Interactive widgets display user distribution across rare destinations through pie charts, with detailed summary tables providing event counts, data volumes, destinations, and timestamps for investigation. Analysts can select users to apply as global filters, or pivot to the User Activity Investigation dashboard for detailed forensic analysis of flagged user activity. This frequency-based analysis enables detection of uncommon data egress destinations, use of unauthorized personal accounts, or access to suspicious destinations that fall outside normal organizational data movement patterns.\nFigure 4. Dashboard section outlining hunting leads for rare data egress events\nAdditional Hunting Capabilities\nThe dashboard includes three additional hunting lead sections targeting specific behavioral anomalies:\nHunting Leads - Data Egress First-seen Activity\n: Identifies users exhibiting new data egress behaviors that deviate from their established patterns, potentially indicating policy violations or unauthorized activity. This section analyzes first-seen web destinations, destination account domains (extracted from cloud usernames), and USB storage devices based on individual users\u2019 historical activity. It compares recent activity within a configurable assessment window (default: 7 days) against historical baselines to detect behavioral changes. Analysts can configure domain exclusions for known legitimate services and adjust the assessment period to balance detection sensitivity with investigation volume, enabling identification of users suddenly accessing new cloud services, connecting unfamiliar storage devices, or egressing data to previously unseen external accounts.\nHunting Leads - Data Egress from Unusual Endpoints\n: Identifies data egress activity from non-standard endpoints potentially indicating malicious insider activity or unauthorized activity. This section analyzes data movement from servers, domain controllers, cloud instances (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), and other non-desktop systems that typically should not be used for routine data transfers. By monitoring egress from these atypical endpoints, analysts can detect unauthorized data transfers from privileged systems, compromised server infrastructure, and cloud workloads being misused for data exfiltration. The section provides configurable endpoint type exclusions, enabling organizations to focus on the most relevant system types for their environment.\nHunting Leads - Activity During Off Hours\n: Identifies data egress events and Falcon Data Protection detections occurring outside normal business hours that might indicate suspicious behaviors. This section analyzes both Falcon Data Protection detections and data egress events during off-hours periods based on configurable timezone and business hour parameters (default: 5 a.m.-10 p.m. CST), enabling organizations to define business hours aligned with their operational context. The section categorizes off-hours activity into three types: weekend activity, activity before business hours start, and activity after business hours end. This helps analysts identify temporal patterns that may indicate malicious intent or unauthorized after-hours data transfers requiring investigation.\nEach section provides interactive summary tables displaying event counts, data volumes, user details, timestamps, destination information, and pivot capabilities to the User Activity Investigation dashboard for detailed analysis of flagged activity.\nIntroducing the User Activity Investigation Dashboard\nThe\nCrowdStrike Falcon Data Protection - User Activity Investigation\ndashboard complements the Insider Threat Analytics dashboard with detailed forensic analysis of user data egress activity. Designed for in-depth investigation workflows, this dashboard enables security analysts to conduct event-level analysis of flagged users and examine behavior patterns, data movement trends, and policy enforcement across web and USB egress channels.\nAnalysts can pivot directly from the Insider Threat Analytics dashboard with user context automatically applied, or conduct standalone investigations of specific users exhibiting suspicious data egress activity. The dashboard is organized into three main sections for detailed investigation workflows, as presented below.\nFalcon Data Protection Detection Analytics\nThis section is replicated across both dashboards to provide complete Falcon Data Protection context during investigations. When examining a specific user's activity in this dashboard, analysts can review both detection patterns (policy violations) and data egress events (broader data movement) without navigating between dashboards, ensuring all relevant Falcon Data Protection telemetry is accessible in a single view.\nData Egress Analytics - Web Destinations\nThis section provides in-depth analysis of web-based data egress activity through statistical breakdowns, destination mapping, trend analysis, and user-focused drill-down functionality. It enables analysts to understand data movement across web egress channels, policy actions, classifications, and content types, revealing web data egress destination patterns, what data is being transferred, and how Falcon Data Protection policies are responding. Analysts can drill down to investigate specific users and examine their detailed web egress activity.\nFigure 5. Dashboard section showcasing data egress analytics for web traffic\nData Egress Analytics - USB Destinations\nThis provides the same in-depth analytical capabilities as the Web Destinations section but covers USB-based data egress activity. Through statistical breakdowns, device mapping, trend analysis, and user-focused drill-down functionality, analysts can understand data movement across USB egress channels, policy actions, classifications, and content types, which reveal USB device usage patterns, what data is being transferred to removable media, and how Falcon Data Protection policies are responding. Analysts can drill down to investigate specific users and examine their detailed USB egress activity.\nFigure 6. Dashboard section showcasing data egress analytics for USB devices\nInvestigation Workflow Features\nThe dashboard provides interactive capabilities designed to streamline investigations and enable seamless navigation across the Falcon platform.\nInteractive Filtering and Navigation\n: Dashboard parameters enable filtering by users, severity levels, policy actions, detection types, egress channels, sensitivity labels, and content patterns to focus analysis on relevant activity. Users can be selected from any table to apply as global filters across all dashboard sections, automatically narrowing all widgets to that user's activity. When pivoting to the User Activity Investigation dashboard, high-risk users are automatically applied as global filters to streamline the transition from risk identification to detailed analysis.\nFigure 7. Dashboard feature to filter and down-select detections on a given user\nPlatform Navigation\n: Interactive widgets provide direct links to the Falcon Data Protection Detections page for policy review, the Falcon Data Protection Events page for operational context, and Identity Protection user profiles for behavioral risk context. The Advanced Event Search link enables complex query-based investigation for analysts requiring custom analysis beyond dashboard capabilities.\nHunting Customization\n: Configurable parameters allow customization for hunting thresholds including rare destination counts, first-seen assessment periods, off-hours definitions, and endpoint type exclusions. This enables analysts to tune behavioral anomaly detection based on organizational context and investigation priorities.\nInsider Threat Detection Mapping\nThe following table maps insider threat types to their primary detection signals, corresponding dashboard sections, and recommended response strategies:\nTable 1.

The following scenarios, emulated by the CrowdStrike team, demonstrate how the CrowdStrike Falcon - Insider Threat Analytics dashboard detects real-world insider threat techniques through multi-layered behavioral analytics and risk scoring. Each scenario includes the attack pattern, detection methodology, and specific dashboard capabilities that enable identification and investigation.\nScenario 1: Data Exfiltration to New Destinations\nAttack Pattern\nA malicious insider leverages their legitimate access to exfiltrate sensitive data to previously unseen web destinations \u2014 personal cloud storage, file-sharing services, or external platforms outside their normal activity patterns. This technique is particularly effective because the insider's access is authorized and data handling appears routine until the exfiltration destination is examined.\nAttack Stages:\nBaseline Establishment\n: The insider operates normally for weeks or months, establishing a behavioral baseline.\nTarget Selection\n: Sensitive files are identified and accessed through legitimate business processes.\nNew Destination Setup\n: Personal accounts are created on cloud platforms (Dropbox, Google Drive, personal email).\nExfiltration\n: Data is uploaded to the new destination, often during off-hours or in small increments to avoid volume-based detection.\nDetection Methodology\nThe\nHunting Leads - Data Egress First-seen Activity\nsection detects this technique through timestamp-based baseline comparison that identifies when users egress data to new destinations or devices not seen in their historical activity. The following hunting query can be used to replicate this detection logic in Advanced Event Search for custom investigations or automated alerting:\n// ===================================================================\r\n// First-Seen Web Destination Detection Query\r\n// Purpose: Identifies users accessing new web destinations not seen \r\n//          in their historical baseline activity\r\n// ===================================================================\r\n\r\n// Base Query - Web Data Egress Events\r\n#repo=\"base_sensor\" #event_simpleName=\"DataEgress\"\r\n| parseJson(DataEgressDestination, prefix=destination.)\r\n| destination.channel[0]=0 // Filter to Web egress channel only\r\n\r\n// Create timestamp-based flags for baseline comparison\r\n| case {\r\n    test(@timestamp > now() - duration(7d)) | _new_event := true;           // Event in assessment window (last 7 days)\r\n    * | _baseline_event := true;      // Event in baseline window (older than 7 days)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Extract destination domain from URL for analysis\r\n| destination.web_destination[0].host_url[0]=/(https?:\\/\\/)?(?<_domain_name>[^\\/]+)/\r\n\r\n// Aggregate by user and destination domain\r\n| groupBy([UserSid, _domain_name], limit=max, function=[\r\n    count(field=_new_event, as=_new_event_count),\r\n    count(field=_baseline_event, as=_baseline_event_count),\r\n    collect([UserName, ComputerName, NormalizedPath, \r\n             destination.web_destination[0].web_location_name[0], \r\n             destination.web_destination[0].cloud_username[0], \r\n             destination.web_destination[0].host_url[0]])\r\n])\r\n\r\n// Filter to first-seen destinations (present in assessment, absent in baseline)\r\n| _baseline_event_count=0 _new_event_count>0\r\n\r\n// Format output for investigation\r\n| rename(destination.web_destination[0].web_location_name[0], as=Destination)\r\n| rename(destination.web_destination[0].cloud_username[0], as=\"Cloud UserName\")\r\n| rename(destination.web_destination[0].host_url[0], as=URL)\r\n| table([UserName, ComputerName, Destination, \"Cloud UserName\", URL, NormalizedPath])\nFigure 8. First-seen Web Destination for User - Hunting Query results\nScenario 2: Mass Data Collection and Bulk Export to Cloud Storage\nAttack Pattern\nA compromised user account is abused to conduct mass data collection followed by bulk export to a cloud storage service. The adversary uses the compromised credentials to search and download sensitive files from network shares, SharePoint, or corporate cloud storage to the local endpoint (staging), then uploads the aggregated data to an attacker-controlled cloud account.\nAttack Stages\nAccount Compromise and Endpoint Access\n: The adversary gains user credentials and access to a workstation.\nData Collection and Staging\n: The adversary searches network shares, SharePoint sites, and other repositories, downloading sensitive files to the local endpoint (data staging).\nBulk Export\n: Large data volumes are uploaded from the staged endpoint to attacker-controlled cloud storage that mimics legitimate data egress processes (Google Drive, Dropbox, other).\nEgress Volume Spike\n: The bulk upload creates an unusual spike in egress volume from the endpoint.\nDetection Methodology\nThe\nCrowdStrike Falcon - Insider Threat Analytics\ndashboard detects this attack pattern through multiple correlated indicators:\nThe Insider Risk Indicators section flags users exceeding 1% of company-wide egress volume.\nThe Egress Data Volume over Time widget in the Falcon Data Protection Detection Analytics section visually displays the volume spike, revealing the sudden uptick characteristic of bulk export operations.\nThe Hunting Leads - Rare Events section surfaces users accessing rare destination account domains. The attacker-controlled cloud account often has a domain not matching organizational email patterns, which then appears in hunting results.\nElevated identity risk scores (due to compromised credentials) combined with data egress activity elevate the total risk score in case of a compromised account.\nFor analysts requiring customized detection parameters or scheduled monitoring, the following query replicates the volume anomaly and suspicious account detection logic:\n// =====================================================================\r\n// Users Responsible for >1% of Company-Wide Data Egress Volume\r\n// Purpose: Identifies users performing bulk data exports that exceed\r\n//          organizational volume thresholds, indicating potential mass\r\n//          data collection and exfiltration operations\r\n// =====================================================================\r\n\r\n// Base query - All data egress events\r\n#repo=\"base_sensor\" #event_simpleName=\"DataEgress\"\r\n\r\n// Parse JSON objects for destination and data protection properties\r\n| parseJson(DataEgressDestination, prefix=destination.)\r\n| parseJson(DataProtectionProperties, prefix=properties.)\r\n\r\n// Classify egress channel type\r\n| case { \r\n    destination.channel[0]=0 | \"Egress Channel\" := \"Web\";\r\n    destination.channel[0]=1 | \"Egress Channel\" := \"USB\";\r\n    * | \"Egress Channel\" := \"Other\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Calculate volumes: company-wide total and per-user aggregation\r\n| stats([\r\n    // Compute total company-wide data egress volume for percentage calculation\r\n    sum(Size, as=_total_egress_volume),\r\n    \r\n    // Aggregate by user with volume and contextual details\r\n    groupBy(UserSid, limit=max, function=[\r\n        sum(Size, as=_user_egress_volume),\r\n        collect([UserName, \"Egress Channel\",\r\n            properties.origin_web_locations[0].web_location_name[0], \r\n            properties.origin_web_locations[0].cloud_username[0], \r\n            destination.web_destination[0].web_location_name[0], \r\n            destination.web_destination[0].cloud_username[0]\r\n        ])\r\n    ])\r\n])\r\n\r\n// Calculate user's percentage of company-wide egress volume\r\n| _user_percentage := (_user_egress_volume / _total_egress_volume) * 100\r\n\r\n// Filter to volume anomalies (>1% threshold - adjust as needed)\r\n| _user_percentage > 1\r\n\r\n// Format output for investigation\r\n| unit:convert(_user_egress_volume, from=\"B\", to=\"GB\")\r\n| _user_percentage_display := format(\"%.2f%%\", field=_user_percentage)\r\n| rename(properties.origin_web_locations[0].web_location_name[0], as=\"Data Origin\")\r\n| rename(properties.origin_web_locations[0].cloud_username[0], as=\"Origin Cloud UserName\")\r\n| rename(destination.web_destination[0].web_location_name[0], as=\"Egress Destination\")\r\n| rename(destination.web_destination[0].cloud_username[0], as=\"Destination Cloud UserName\")\r\n| rename(_user_egress_volume, as=\"Volume (GB)\")\r\n| rename(_user_percentage_display, as=\"% of Company Total\")\r\n| table([UserName, \"Volume (GB)\", \"% of Company Total\", \"Egress Channel\", \r\n        \"Data Origin\", \"Origin Cloud UserName\", \"Egress Destination\", \r\n        \"Destination Cloud UserName\"], \r\n       sortby=_user_percentage, order=desc)\nFigure 9. Identifies users performing bulk data exports that exceed organizational volume thresholds\nConclusion\nInsider threats and risks represent a significant challenge for modern organizations, requiring sophisticated detection capabilities that go beyond traditional security controls. By combining multi-source risk scoring, behavioral anomaly detection, and data egress visibility, companies can dramatically reduce the likelihood and impact of insider incidents.\nThe\nCrowdStrike Falcon - Insider Threat Analytics\nand\nCrowdStrike Falcon Data Protection - User Activity Investigation\ndashboards provide an integrated insider threat detection and investigation workflow. The Insider Threat Analytics dashboard identifies high-risk users through automated scoring and behavioral hunting, while the User Activity Investigation dashboard enables detailed forensic analysis of flagged activity. This architecture streamlines the progression from risk identification to analysis and incident response.\nBy implementing these dashboards, security teams gain proactive detection of insider threats, enhanced monitoring for departing employees and high-risk users, and adaptable behavioral anomaly detection tuned to organizational context \u2014 protecting sensitive data and operations before insider incidents result in significant organizational harm.\nAdditional Resources\nLearn more about insider threats within this article:\nInsider Threats Explained\n.\nRead more about new Falcon Data Protection capabilities in\nCrowdStrike Strengthens Data Security Across Endpoint, Cloud, and SaaS Applications\n.\nDive in and try out Falcon Data Protection in this self-paced\ninteractive demo\n.\nTweet\nShare\nRelated Content\nHow to Scale SOC Automation with Falcon Fusion SOAR\nTransform AWS Security Operations with Falcon Next-Gen SIEM\nCrowdStrike Leads New Evolution of Security Automation with Charlotte Agentic SOAR\nCategories\nAgentic SOC\n47\nCloud & Application Security\n139\nData Protection\n21\nEndpoint Security & XDR\n349\nEngineering & Tech\n86\nExecutive Viewpoint\n177\nExposure Management\n115\nFrom The Front Lines\n197\nNext-Gen Identity Security\n67\nNext-Gen SIEM & Log Management\n110\nPublic Sector\n40\nSecuring AI\n25\nThreat Hunting & Intel\n210\nCONNECT WITH US\nFEATURED ARTICLES\nOctober 01, 2024\nCrowdStrike Named a Leader in 2024 Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Endpoint Protection Platforms\nSeptember 25, 2024\nRecognizing the Resilience of the CrowdStrike Community\nSeptember 25, 2024\nCrowdStrike Drives Cybersecurity Forward with New Innovations Spanning AI, Cloud, Next-Gen SIEM and Identity Protection\nSeptember 18, 2024\nSUBSCRIBE\nSign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from CrowdStrike.\nSign Up\nSee CrowdStrike Falcon\n\u00ae\nin Action\nDetect, prevent, and respond to attacks\u2014 even malware-free intrusions\u2014at any stage, with next-generation endpoint protection.\nSee Demo\nHow to Scale SOC Automation with Falcon Fusion SOAR\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 CrowdStrike\nPrivacy\nRequest Info\nBlog\nContact Us\n1.888.512.8906\nAccessibility",

Authentication\nCrowdStrike has the most five-star ratings of any vendor evaluated in the report, based on the most verified ratings of any vendor.\nFebruary 12, 2026\n|\nRyan Terry\n|\nNext-Gen Identity Security\nCrowdStrike has been named a Customers\u2019 Choice in the 2026 Gartner Peer Insights\u2122 \u201cVoice of the Customer for User Authentication\u201d report. For the second consecutive year, CrowdStrike has the highest volume of verified reviews and more 5-star ratings (129) than any other vendor in the report based on 179 overall responses in the 2026 report. This recognition includes a 96% Willingness to Recommend rating, which we believe reflects our commitment to delivering elite, AI-powered identity security.\nIdentity is the front line of modern attacks. Adversaries steal and purchase legitimate credentials to log in and move laterally across hybrid environments. As AI agents and non-human identities proliferate across enterprise environments, it is imperative for organizations to unify protection across every identity. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Next-Gen Identity Security, a core pillar of the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform, is designed to deliver continuous, real-time identity protection for the AI era.\nWe believe this Gartner recognition validates our mission to provide a unified identity fabric that secures every identity \u2014 human, non-human, and AI agents \u2014 across the modern attack chain.\nHear from Our Customers\nCrowdStrike\u2019s momentum is driven by the success of our users. In this report, customers rated CrowdStrike 4.7/5 for both Product Capabilities \u2014 tied among all vendors recognized as a Customers\u2019 Choice based on 99 reviews \u2014 and Deployment Experience based on 94 reviews, as well as 4.5/5 for Support and Sales Experience based on 94 and 65 reviews, respectively.\nBelow is a snapshot of the peer insights that led to this distinction:\nClear Visibility Into Identity Threats and Reliable Real-Time Detection\n\u201cOur overall experience with CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security has been very smooth and effective. The solution is easy to use and provides clear visibility into identity-based threats in real time. Compared to our previous setup, monitoring and detections are much more reliable and the overall user experience is significantly better.\u201d\n\u2013\nIT Security & Risk Manager, IT Services Industry\nCrowdStrike Identity: Simplifying Access to Crucial Company Information\n\u201cIn deep detail over the whole company in one tool. With CrowdStrike\u2019s Identity solution, it\u2019s nice to see all the info together ... regarding the setup and performance, it is incredibly easy to set up with one agent for all. Performance is also surprisingly fast without any delay despite covering hundreds of DCs and thousands of accounts.\u201d\n\u2013\nGlobal IAM Manager, Energy and Utilities Industry\nCrowdStrike Falcon Identity Protection \u2014 A Great Tool to Gain Visibility\n\u201cAfter a year of CrowdStrike\u2019s identity solution, I\u2019m very impressed with the level of visibility and control it provides over identity-based threats. It has helped us detect and respond to suspicious account activity in real time, and its integration with our existing security stack has been seamless. The insights into lateral movement and credential misuse are especially valuable. Overall, it's a powerful solution that has strengthened our identity security posture significantly.\u201d\n\u2013\nIT Security & Risk Manager, Retail Industry\nA Unified Defense for the AI Era\nAs organizations face an expanding identity attack surface, legacy IAM and PAM tools \u2014 built to manage access rather than stop threats \u2014 are no longer enough. CrowdStrike delivers a proactive defense through three key pillars:\nUnified visibility\n: CrowdStrike closes gaps by creating a continuous control plane across on-premises, cloud, and SaaS environments. This unified fabric allows security teams to see and protect every identity type.\nReal-time enforcement\n: Identity security now requires a shift from static login checks to continuous evaluation. The Falcon platform combines AI-powered detection with dynamic authorization to revoke privileges mid-session if threat conditions change.\nOperational efficiency\n: By delivering identity threat detection and response (ITDR), privileged access, and multifactor authentication (MFA) through a single lightweight sensor and console, we help eliminate tool sprawl.\nContinuous Innovation: Our Intent to Acquire SGNL\nCrowdStrike is further strengthening our authentication leadership with our recently\nannounced intent to acquire SGNL\n. This move is a direct response to the evolving needs of our customers. With this acquisition, we will eliminate standing privileges and add continuous, dynamic authorization to the Falcon platform. By integrating SGNL\u2019s capabilities, we are elevating Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security to protect every identity across the entire lifecycle \u2014 from preventing malicious access and privilege abuse to responding in real time to threats before impact.\nWe remain committed to innovating at the speed of the adversary. With the addition of SGNL and the power of the Falcon platform, CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to secure the identity fabric of the modern enterprise.\nAdditional Resources\nRead the full\n2026 Gartner Peer Insights\u2122 Voice of the Customer for User Authentication report\n.\nExplore the\nCrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen Identity Security\nproduct page.\nDownload the\nComplete Guide to Next-Gen Identity Security\n.\nGARTNER and PEER INSIGHTS are trademarks of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates.

with confidence\nFebruary 11, 2026\n|\nPaola Miranda\n|\nNext-Gen SIEM & Log Management\nMost SOC teams don\u2019t struggle with what they need to automate \u2014 they struggle with where to start. Between complex playbooks, brittle integrations, and the fear of breaking something in production, security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) often feels harder to adopt than it should be.\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Fusion SOAR was built to change that. It\u2019s designed to meet teams where they are in their security automation maturity journey, whether they\u2019re starting with simple, high-impact automations or focused on scale. For example, a team might begin by automating a common response like forcing a password reset when an account is flagged as compromised, then build toward more advanced AI-powered and agentic workflows as their automation program matures.\nWhile anyone can get started building workflows with Falcon Fusion SOAR, organizations with mature automation programs will be able to use the agentic and agent orchestration capabilities of CrowdStrike\u2019s Charlotte Agentic SOAR. Falcon Fusion SOAR provides the workflow engine and execution layer that allows security teams to build and run workflows, orchestrate agents, and automate actions across security processes in a single, unified system. This empowers teams to move beyond rule-based, task-driven automation and toward a reasoning-powered, agent-driven response as their programs evolve.\nSee how Falcon Fusion SOAR orchestrates intelligent agents as part of Charlotte Agentic SOAR to drive coordinated, agent-powered response across the CrowdStrike Falcon platform:\nWhile agentic SOAR is the destination where AI handles reasoning, Falcon Fusion SOAR is the engine that gets you there by automating the foundational tasks you do today. This blog provides guidance to teams getting started and explains how three new enhancements in Falcon Fusion SOAR help them on the journey.\nWhether you\u2019re building your first automation workflow or exploring how AI can simplify everyday SOC tasks, the goal is to help you take practical first steps that deliver value quickly and build confidence over time.\nStart with One Workflow, Then Scale\nThe industry best practice for adopting SOAR is to start by automating one well-understood workflow end to end, prove value quickly, and then build from there.\nTeams are most successful when they begin with processes that are frequent, repeatable, and consistently slow analysts down \u2014 such as malware triage, phishing response, or compromised account remediation. These workflows already have defined decision points and response steps, which makes them easier to automate and easier to trust early on.\nFalcon Fusion SOAR enables analysts to take a familiar manual process and turn it into a repeatable workflow that automatically kicks off based on real activity in the Falcon platform, then orchestrates response across Falcon and your connected third-party tools through built-in integrations. By starting small, teams can see immediate impact, build confidence in automation, and establish patterns they can reuse as they scale across the SOC.\nFalcon Fusion SOAR\u2019s workflows can act immediately on endpoint, identity, cloud, and threat intelligence data. This lets teams move faster by grounding automation in native Falcon platform context, while still orchestrating actions across integrated third-party tools when needed.\nAt the end of this post, we\u2019ll point you to a practical blueprint that walks through five common SOAR use cases many teams start with, providing a clear path to put these ideas into practice.\nWhat\u2019s New in Falcon Fusion SOAR\nRecent Falcon Fusion SOAR enhancements focus on three critical areas: giving practitioners confidence to test workflows safely before they reach production, accelerating how workflows are built with the Workflow Generation Agent, and using generative AI to simplify advanced automation use cases, turning complex logic and data transformation into simple interactions.\nTogether, these capabilities help analysts move faster without sacrificing control by using AI to assist with reasoning and data transformation in a more intuitive, conversational way.\nThe Workflow Generation Agent helps teams accelerate how automation is created. Analysts can describe the workflow they want to build in natural language, and the agent translates their intent into a structured automation flow. This lowers the effort required to get started, shortens time to value, and makes it easier for more practitioners to contribute to automation without deep SOAR expertise.\nSee how the Workflow Generation Agent turns natural language input into a structured automation workflow, helping analysts get started faster without deep SOAR expertise:\nOnce workflows are created, it\u2019s important to validate how they behave before they\u2019re put into action. Instead of learning how a workflow behaves during a live incident, analysts can now test logic ahead of time in a controlled environment. The test-and-debug experience provides visibility into how a workflow will execute, making it easy to validate conditions, inspect variables at each step, and understand execution paths before anything runs in production.\nPreview and validate how workflows execute before they run in production, so automation behaves as intended:\nBy catching issues early and removing guesswork, teams can iterate on workflows more confidently, reduce the risk of unintended actions, and move from experimentation to reliable, production-ready automation faster.\nSecurity data rarely arrives in the format automation needs, which can slow workflows down or stop automation from working as intended. The Data Transformation Agent, powered by CrowdStrike Charlotte AI, allows analysts to use generative AI to transform data through natural, guided conversations.\nSee how the Data Transformation Agent, powered by CrowdStrike Charlotte AI, uses generative AI to produce workflow-ready data:\nInstead of writing scripts or manually mapping fields, analysts can describe the transformation they need in plain language. The agent guides the process and helps produce structured output that workflows can immediately act on. This makes advanced data transformation accessible to more analysts and allows workflows to move forward without friction or guesswork.\nA Practical Path to SOAR Adoption\nFalcon Fusion SOAR is built to remove the repetitive work that slows analysts down. Humans stay in control while automation handles the steps that don\u2019t require their judgment.\nOur new white paper,\nThe Essential SOAR Playbook: Practical Use Cases for Modern Security Teams\n, is a hands-on guide for teams getting started with Falcon Fusion SOAR. It focuses on concrete workflows SOCs can deploy immediately to show how automation fits into real day-to-day operations.\nIf you\u2019re evaluating Falcon Fusion SOAR for the first time, or looking to put it into practice, this white paper offers a starting point:\nSee which workflows teams automate first\nUnderstand how native SOAR changes speed and reliability\nLearn how AI-assisted automation helps SOCs scale safely\nDownload our SOAR playbook to see how teams are getting started with Falcon Fusion SOAR and where automation can make an immediate impact in your SOC.\nAdditional Resources\nDownload\nThe Essential SOAR Playbook: Practical Use Cases for Modern Security Teams\nto see how security teams are putting Falcon Fusion SOAR into action.\nWant to learn more about Falcon Fusion SOAR?

Stanham\n|\nAgentic SOC\nAdversaries are continuously evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures to evade both legacy and AI-native defenses, and they\u2019re using AI to their advantage. Stopping them requires a new approach: humans and AI working together.\nWhile AI can correlate massive volumes of telemetry at machine speed, pattern recognition alone is not enough to stop modern attacks. Training on detections teaches models what happened, but not why it mattered. AI cannot independently reason like an experienced analyst or reliably distinguish benign anomalies from true malicious intent, especially when facing novel tradecraft.\nAt CrowdStrike, adaptive AI systems are continuously guided, validated, and reinforced by elite defenders with real-time understanding of adversary behavior. Agents operate with expert human judgment, delivering proven accuracy that keeps pace with modern adversaries, and meets the demands of high-stakes SOC environments.\nIn this blog, we explore CrowdStrike\u2019s human-AI feedback loop and how it powers high-performance agentic defense.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Expert-Annotated Security Data\nCrowdStrike analyzes\ntrillions of security events per day\nacross endpoints, identities, cloud workloads, and applications. But the real advantage comes from how that data is interpreted, annotated, and validated by humans who stop breaches.\nCrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Complete Next-Gen MDR analysts and CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Adversary OverWatch\u2122 threat hunters interpret attackers\u2019 intent, analyze tradecraft, and document how adversaries operate during live intrusions. Their reasoning is continuously fed back into CrowdStrike\u2019s training corpus, creating a living dataset grounded in real-world decision-making. The result is an expert-validated security data layer that no synthetic, scraped, or unlabeled dataset can match \u2014 and which forms the foundation for CrowdStrike\u2019s agentic security capabilities.\nIn the sections that follow, we explore how this human-validated intelligence powers high-performance AI \u2014 and how that AI helps experts scale their response with speed and precision.\nFigure 1. Continuous feedback loop, powered by the world's largest threat telemetry dataset and validated by elite analysts\nThe Human-AI Feedback Loop in Action\nExpert-Annotated Data Enables Analyst Grade AI\nTeaching an AI agent why a decision was made, not merely what happened, requires human-annotated data that captures how analysts interpret context, evaluate subtle signals, and analyze adversary tradecraft. This depth of insight cannot be scraped or generated by a large language model (LLM).\nAt CrowdStrike, every triage, escalation, and remediation action executed by Falcon Complete analysts informs and trains the underlying models powering CrowdStrike\u2019s agentic capabilities. Expert annotations capture the reasoning behind decisions: which signals mattered, how intent was interpreted, and why certain actions were taken. This gives agents a blueprint for analyst-grade judgment. This constant stream of expert insight gives CrowdStrike\u2019s agents a dynamic understanding of attacker patterns and emerging behaviors. They get smarter every time an analyst makes a decision and learn to perform analyst-grade reasoning \u2014 distinguishing threats from noise and adapting to novel tradecraft.\nHuman expertise is especially critical when adversaries blend into normal behavior patterns. Falcon Complete analysts, in close collaboration with Falcon Adversary OverWatch threat hunters, apply nuanced contextual knowledge of attacker intent and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that even advanced models can\u2019t fully infer. They identify subtle behaviors that evade automated detection, such as lateral movement disguised as administrative activity or identity misuse that mimics legitimate workflows.\nThe CrowdStrike difference:\nCrowdStrike\u2019s expert-validated training data enables CrowdStrike Charlotte AI\u2122 and our mission-ready AI agents to deliver precise, reliable outcomes at machine speed. This results in high-fidelity reasoning and measurable outcomes: Charlotte AI delivers 98% triage accuracy,\n1\nsaves analysts 15+ minutes per investigation,\n2\nand enables some customers to respond up to three times faster.\n3\nThis drives faster, more consistent SOC outcomes.\nExpert Reinforcement Drives Continuous Improvement\nBuilding a production-grade agent requires dedicated measurement and refinement. Without ongoing evaluation, reinforcement, and correction, an agent\u2019s accuracy will drift.\nFalcon Complete analysts continuously review, validate, and score Charlotte AI\u2019s decisions during real intrusions, including novel threats. This creates the high-quality reinforcement data needed to correct performance, detect drift, and ensure agents evolve alongside adversary tradecraft.\nThis unique feedback cycle compounds over time. As AI triages simple detections, analysts respond faster and reallocate attention to higher-value detections, generating more expert-labeled data to fuel the next round of training. The result is an accelerating accuracy flywheel: Agents improve, analysts become more efficient, and each cycle produces richer data to strengthen future iterations.\nThe CrowdStrike difference:\nNo startup, legacy vendor, or model provider can replicate this accuracy flywheel at this level. It requires an elite managed services organization, singular focus on cybersecurity, massive operational scale, and deeply integrated platform telemetry \u2014 capabilities only CrowdStrike brings together.\nHow Agentic AI Accelerates CrowdStrike\u2019s Expert Analysis\nOur agents aren't just for customers. They\u2019re built for and battle-tested by Falcon Complete analysts who use them extensively to detect, investigate, and contain adversary activity during real-world intrusions.\nDuring active ransomware operations, nation-state intrusions, and sophisticated campaigns, AI agents operate in parallel with our experts to accelerate critical investigative tasks: triaging newly issued detections, analyzing endpoints for additional malicious behavior, evaluating identity signals for account compromise, searching for evidence of lateral movement, and correlating IOC prevalence using integrated global threat intelligence. What would normally require multiple tools and manual pivots happens in parallel, delivering immediate context that our analysts use to validate threats, determine scope, and execute decisive containment.\nThe CrowdStrike difference:\nThis division of labor accelerates investigations, sharpens decisions, and reduces analyst fatigue, enabling Falcon Complete experts to stop intrusions faster and with greater confidence. Every action taken by our analysts feeds back into the platform, continuously improving detection and response based on real-world adversary behavior.\nThe Future of Human and AI Defense\nCrowdStrike delivers security outcomes organizations can trust because human expertise and AI operate as one unified system. The CrowdStrike Falcon platform brings together AI, automation, expert intelligence, and the industry\u2019s richest AI-ready data layer. Falcon Complete provides the expert-led execution layer that puts this system to work against real adversaries every day.\nBy embedding AI directly into the Falcon platform architecture, insights from frontline defenders flow immediately back into the platform. The strength of our platform is consistently and independently validated. In the\n2025 MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Enterprise Evaluations\n, CrowdStrike achieved 100% detection and 100% protection with zero false positives, confirming the effectiveness of an AI-native platform built to perform against real adversaries at scale.\nAgentic AI amplifies the effectiveness of CrowdStrike\u2019s managed detection and response (MDR) and threat hunting teams by enabling them to investigate faster, respond earlier, and stop breaches before impact spreads. What sets CrowdStrike apart isn\u2019t AI alone \u2014 it\u2019s the human-AI feedback loop that continuously sharpens it. Every analyst decision strengthens the platform.

Management\nCrowdStrike is the only vendor to be named a Customers\u2019 Choice for the second year in a row.\nFebruary 09, 2026\n|\nRona Kedmi\n|\nExposure Management\nExternal attack surfaces are expanding faster than most organizations can track. Internet-facing cloud services, network devices, commercial AI tools, and third-party infrastructure are driving the growth of unintended exposure outside security teams\u2019 control. CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Exposure Management, delivered through the unified CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae platform, identifies known and unknown assets across the external attack surface and internal systems, and prioritizes vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited, so organizations can reduce their risk.\nCrowdStrike has been named a Customers\u2019 Choice in the 2025 Gartner\u00ae Peer Insights\u2122 Voice of the Customer for External Attack Surface Management (EASM) report. We are the only company with this distinction in both years the report has been published.\nWe believe this recognition reflects the trust organizations place in CrowdStrike to prioritize and remediate risk across their environments. By unifying external attack surface visibility with internal exposure context, adversary-driven prioritization, and attack path analysis, Falcon Exposure Management provides customers with a continuous view of exposure risk.\nWhat Our Customers Say\nThe Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer provides a quantitative view of the market based on peer reviews. Vendors are evaluated across two dimensions: \u201cUser Interest and Adoption\u201d and \u201cOverall Experience.\u201d Placement in the Customers\u2019 Choice quadrant requires meeting or exceeding the market average on both axes.\nIn the recent External Attack Surface Management report, CrowdStrike met the Customers\u2019 Choice criteria based on verified feedback from end users evaluating EASM solutions across product capabilities, deployment experience, and support. CrowdStrike received an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars and 93% willingness to recommend, based on 29 reviews as of September 2025.\nBelow is a sampling of customer reviews:\n\u201cPowerful Attack Surface Visibility\u201d\n\"The platform provides clear visibility into our external attack surface, identifying both known and unknown assets that were previously blind spots.

Notably, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added CVE-2026-20127 and CVE-2022-20775 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on Feb. 25, 2026. As a result of the malicious cyber activity and vulnerabilities involving Cisco SD-WAN systems, CISA has outlined requirements for FCEB agencies in Emergency Directive (ED) 26-03 to inventory Cisco SD-WAN systems, update them, and assess compromise. CISA and partners have observed malicious cyber actors targeting and compromising Cisco SD-WAN systems of organizations, globally. These actors have been observed exploiting a previously undisclosed authentication bypass vulnerability, CVE-2026-20127, for initial access before escalating privileges using CVE-2022-20775 and establishing long-term persistence in Cisco SD-WAN systems.

GrayBravo demonstrates strong adaptability, responsiveness to public exposure, and operates a large-scale, multi-layered infrastructure. Recent analysis of GrayBravo\u2019s ecosystem uncovered four distinct activity clusters leveraging the group\u2019s CastleLoader malware, each defined by unique tactics, techniques, and victim profiles. These findings reinforce the assessment that GrayBravo operates a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. For example, one cluster, tracked as TAG-160, impersonates global logistics firms, using phishing lures and the ClickFix technique to distribute CastleLoader while spoofing legitimate emails and exploiting freight-matching platforms to target victims. Another cluster, tracked as TAG-161, impersonates Booking.com, also employing ClickFix to deliver CastleLoader and Matanbuchus and novel phishing email management tools. Further investigation through historical panel analysis linked the online persona \u201cSparja\u201d, a user active on Exploit Forums, to potential GrayBravo-associated activities, based on the alias\u2019s distinctiveness and related discussion topics. To protect against GrayBravo, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated loaders, infostealers, and remote access trojans (RATs), flag and potentially block connections to unusual legitimate internet services (LISs) such as Pastebin, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort, Sigma) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the Mitigations section for implementation guidance and Appendix H for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs). Key Findings Insikt Group uncovered four distinct activity clusters leve",
